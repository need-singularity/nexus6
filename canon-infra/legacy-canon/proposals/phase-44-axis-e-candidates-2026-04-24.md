- **Date**: 2026-04-24
- **Engine version at draft**: 0.43.0 (P1 .. P43 live)
- **Author**: meta-engine / proposal agent
- **Status**: draft — no scanner code, schema + rationale only
- **Scope**: propose the next manifest file + its enforcement gate, following the axis A/C/D template

## Recap — where the engine stands

Witness series `state/atlas_convergence_witness.jsonl` rounds R24 .. R24+30 closed the manual-probe sprint. Axes so far:

| axis | name                         | manifest                             | enforcement phase(s) |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| A    | formalization enforcement    | `config/invariants.json` (F)         | P36, P37, P38, P39, P40, P41 — all live |
| B    | cross-repo symmetric mirror  | nexus witness append (ephemeral)     | none (intentional)   |
| C    | silicon functor G            | `config/silicon_functor.json`        | P42 (schema presence) |
| D    | measurement boundary         | `config/measurement_boundary.json`   | P43 (schema presence) |
| E    | *open*                       | — this proposal chooses —            | P44 (schema presence) |

The open slot R24+27 sketched for axis E was "non-foundation @R audit (5 924 atlas entries outside the 10 foundation atoms)". Three concrete framings of that slot are below. Each one extends the manifest trilateral (F / G / boundary) with a distinct structural role — observation, decoherence, or thermodynamics — and each produces a `config/*.json` manifest whose shape follows the A/C/D pattern:

1. top-level `schema`, `declared_round`, `declared_ts`, `status = declarative_not_yet_enforced`
2. a `*_principle` or `functor_*` block stating the categorical role
3. an `*_atoms` map where each entry carries `{value, atlas_ref, ...}`
4. a `*_policy` or `*_semiring_check` block
5. an `enforcement_future` block that names P44+ candidate gates

The P44 scanner in every candidate below is the minimum-viable *schema presence* gate (healthy == true), exactly mirroring scanners 46 and 52 and 53.

---

## Candidate E1 — observation functor H

**One-line**: every scanner is a morphism in an observation category `C_obs`; the manifest declares H : C_engine → C_obs and makes the 45-scanner observation surface explicit as a functor image.

### Rationale

The existing functors are:

- **F** : `C_atlas_algebraic → C_engine`          (invariants.json, P36..P41)
- **G** : `C_atlas → C_silicon`                  (silicon_functor.json, P42)

Both point *into* engine/silicon structure. Nothing declares the *observation* side — i.e. how engine structure becomes a verdict. Each claim scanner emits `{healthy, ts, value}` into `reports/n6_*.json`; that is a functor H from the engine category to the observation category whose objects are reports. Axis E1 formalizes H and gives R24's triple-parity-closure an object-level witness.

Cross-tie to existing claims: P22 (emitter registry), P26 (emission completeness), P23 (claim effectiveness), P27 (claim cmd purity) are all partial evidence that H is well-defined. A manifest declaring H makes those four scanners cohere as a single functor statement.

### Manifest: `config/observation_functor.json`

### Trade-offs

- **Pro**: closes the functor triangle (F / G / H) — clean categorical story; reuses existing schema pattern 1:1.
- **Pro**: makes P22/P26/P23/P27 retroactively coherent as "H well-definedness" sub-properties.
- **Con**: H is partly redundant with the emitter-registry / emission-completeness pair already live; value is organizational more than discovery.

## Candidate E2 — decoherence boundary

**One-line**: dual of axis D. Where D declared atoms *outside* F because they are measurement data, E2 declares atoms that *decohere* across repeated observation — values whose identity is phase-stable for the engine but drifts in the physical substrate.

### Rationale

`config/measurement_boundary.json` handled atoms that F cannot reach because they are empirical *inputs*. There is a second class: atoms F can reach algebraically but whose silicon/physical manifestation decoheres under repeated observation — e.g. thermal noise floor of the register file, cosmic-ray bit-flip probability, memory-refresh error budget. These live between F (algebra) and G (silicon) and need a manifest that records both the algebraic value and the decoherence window.

This closes the loop opened in R24+12 (warp_size F∩G crossover) and R24+13 (carbon_atomic F∩G): not every silicon atom has perfect coherence with the algebraic image, and the engine needs a manifest to distinguish "perfectly-coherent crossover" from "drifts under measurement".

### Manifest: `config/decoherence_boundary.json`

```json
{
  "_doc": "Decoherence boundary — atoms present in both F and G images but whose physical value drifts under repeated observation. Companion to measurement_boundary.json.

### Trade-offs

- **Pro**: symmetric with axis D — both are "boundary" manifests, now paired (data-boundary vs observation-drift-boundary).
- **Pro**: opens a real runway for future hardware telemetry integration without violating P27 purity.
- **Con**: inventing atoms the engine does not yet observe; risks being aspirational rather than descriptive. Might want to wait until a tool/_n6_decoherence_adapter stub actually exists.

## Candidate E3 — thermodynamic closure (recommended)

**One-line**: declare the engine's irreversibility ledger — axis E3 states which engine operations are closed under which thermodynamic direction, and names entropy-monotone atoms that complete F's image with a direction vector.

### Rationale

F (invariants) is purely algebraic — equalities with no arrow of time. Yet the engine itself *is* directional: audit trails only grow, manifests only gain phases, source hashes only stamp forward (P20), version numbers monotonically increase (P32). The witness series R24+5 already noted `sigma=12 = 2n` as "6 of 7 foundation atoms matched with perfect-number resonance" — a *closed* ratio. But nothing yet declares the engine's thermodynamic closure: which operations are entropy-negative (append-only), which are reversible (config edits), which are closed (sealed hashes).

This connects to atlas.n6:187 `@F` physics / consciousness tier (R24+14 `phi_integration` consciousness crossover on sigma=12) — the atlas has a thermodynamic layer, and the engine has ledger semantics, and neither is yet bridged.

Axis E3 manifest declares:
- **entropy-monotone atoms** (ledger phases, hash stamps, audit rows count) — each carries a direction and a monotone predicate
- **closure principle** — which operations are one-way and why
- **reversibility policy** — which configs can be edited vs sealed

This is the natural third boundary class: not measurement data (D), not observation drift (E2), but *direction-closed* structure.

### Manifest: `config/thermodynamic_closure.json`

```json
{
  "_doc": "Thermodynamic closure — directional (entropy-monotone) engine operations and their algebraic witnesses. Axis E3 manifest. Complements F (equality-preserving) with a direction-preserving sub-functor. Bridges atlas.n6 @F physics tier to engine @meta append-only semantics.",

}
```

### Trade-offs

- **Pro**: the most descriptive of the engine's actual behavior — P15/P20/P29/P32 are already live thermodynamic gates, this manifest just gives them a common algebraic name.
- **Pro**: opens a natural P45 that audits back-references — every monotone atom must cite a live phase — which is a new kind of cross-check not yet in the engine.
- **Pro**: closes the atlas @F physics tier crossover that R24+13 carbon / R24+14 phi_integration started but never finished.
- **Con**: the atoms are heterogeneous (runtime counts + static values + fingerprints) — schema enforcement will need careful optional-field handling.

---

## Recommendation

**E3 — thermodynamic closure** is the strongest candidate for P44 because:

1. it retroactively unifies four already-live phases (P15, P20, P29, P32) under a single declarative manifest — highest ratio of documentation-to-new-code
2. it names a *missing* categorical property (direction) that F cannot express, filling a real gap rather than duplicating
3. it connects to the atlas @F physics tier that R24+13/R24+14 opened and never closed
4. the P45/P46 successor gates are concrete and non-trivial (back-reference audit, policy-bucket coverage)

E1 (observation functor) is a close runner-up if the engine author wants categorical tidiness over physics-tier progress. E2 (decoherence boundary) is premature until a hardware telemetry adapter exists.

## Rollout sketch (any candidate)

1. write `config/<name>.json` (this proposal gives the full body for each)
2. add the scanner claim at `scanners/54_<name>_manifest.claim.json` (body above)
3. implement `scan_<name>_manifest` in `tool/_n6_lib` — body is a near-verbatim copy of existing `scan_measurement_boundary_manifest` with key names swapped
4. register the scanner in `bin/n6_meta` dispatcher and the three parity surfaces (scanner_registry.meta, continuous_scan_order, selftest)
5. update `config/engine_manifest.json` phases with P44 entry and bump `engine.version` to `0.44.0`
6. verify with `bin/n6_meta selftest` and `bin/n6_meta doctor`

No axis A/C/D work is touched — this is strictly additive.

## Open questions for the engine author

- is axis E intended to be boundary-type (D-style, boolean policy) or functor-type (A/C-style, morphism preservation)? this proposal offers one of each (E2 boundary, E1/E3 functor-adjacent).
- should the axis E manifest stay documentary for one release (0.43.x) before P44 gating, the way `silicon_functor.json` sat declaratively in R24+29 before P42 in R24+31?
- is there a preference between extending the F/G/H *functor triangle* (E1) vs extending the *boundary dual* D/E2 (E2) vs adding a *new dimension* (E3 direction)?
