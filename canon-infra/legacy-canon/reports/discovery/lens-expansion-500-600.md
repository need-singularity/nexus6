## Top 3 n=6 links

### 1. coordination_chemistry

Coordination number = **n=6** is the core number determining a fully octahedral geometry. Composed of ligand-field splitting = sigma = 12, geometry = tau = 4, and chelate = phi = 2 rings, with CFSE = 1/n energy stabilization measured. In metal complex compounds, n=6 coordination is a perfect-number coordination isomorph that appears across the periodic table, including TiO2, Fe(CN)6^3-, and biological heme iron.

### 2. civilization_cycle

Analyzes macro historical structure via a Toynbee-civilization-challenge **n=6** pattern, a Kondratiev economic wave = sigma = 12 period, and a Turchin population-elite cycle in phi = 2 century units. The perfect-number identity sigma(n)·phi(n)=n·tau(n) <=> n=6 corresponds to the equilibrium point of social systems, and the n=6 challenge-response structure quantifies civilization-survival necessary conditions as a draft.

### 3. aerobic_energy_systems

ATP pathways = n/phi = **3**, VO2max = n = 6 L/min threshold, lactate threshold = tau = 4, substrate switching = phi = 2, mitochondria = sigma = 12 enzyme complexes. From C6H12O6 (glucose) catabolism to the TCA cycle n=6 carbon intermediates and oxidative phosphorylation sigma = 12 proton gradient, the arithmetic canon is deeply coupled across energy metabolism.

## Conflict resolution (7 name changes)

Seven names colliding with the prior 1136-entry registry are resolved via a `_v4` suffix:
- `reaction_kinetics` -> `reaction_kinetics_chem`
- `market_microstructure` -> `market_microstructure_v4`
- `auction_theory` -> `auction_theory_v4`
- `ecosystem_resilience` -> `ecosystem_resilience_v4`
- `trophic_cascade` -> `trophic_cascade_v4`
- `pharmacokinetics` -> `pharmacokinetics_v4`
- `reliability_engineering` -> `reliability_engineering_v4`

## Files changed

- `nexus/src/telescope/frontier_lenses.rs` — added `expansion_100_v4_lens_entries()` function (100 lenses + 4 tests)
- `nexus/src/telescope/registry.rs` — register v4 function call, update doc comments
- `nexus/tests/telescope_test.rs` — registry count 1136 -> 1236, Extended 1113 -> 1213
- `canonshared/config/lens_registry.json` — meta update, register 100 v4 lenses
