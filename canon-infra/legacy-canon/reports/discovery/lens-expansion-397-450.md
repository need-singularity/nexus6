## Top-3 lens details

### 1. BayesianInferenceLens

The Bayesian-inference lens detects prior/posterior probability convergence structure in data. Core algorithm: (1) Bayes factor threshold (tau-1=3) resonance detection, (2) KL-divergence convergence measured via early/late variance ratio on the time series, (3) mean resonance with the n=6 constant set (N6=6, TAU=4, SIGMA=12, PHI=2, SOPFR=5), (4) uncertainty-reduction rate (mean/std ratio). n=6 link: beta-distribution alpha+beta=n=6 (symmetric prior), Bayes-factor strong-evidence threshold = 3 = tau-1, update steps = sigma/phi = 6, KL convergence threshold = 1/n = 1/6. Core metrics: `bayes_factor_score`, `convergence`, `uncertainty_reduction`, `bayesian_score` (0~1).

### 2. AttractorBasinLens

The attractor-basin lens detects fixed points, periodic orbits, and basin structure of dynamical systems. (1) Dwell ratio near fixed points (mean +/- 0.5*std), (2) period-doubling detection (lag=2,4,8 autocorrelation > 0.5), (3) bimodal-structure ratio, (4) n=6 constant resonance. n=6 link: Lorenz-attractor wings = phi = 2, fixed points = tau-1 = 3, basin levels = n/phi = 3, chaos->order parameter = n = 6, period-doubling threshold iterations = tau = 4. Core metrics: `fixed_point_score`, `period_doubling`, `bimodal`, `attractor_score`.

### 3. PersistenceHomologyLens

The persistent-homology lens measures topological features of data (connected components, holes, higher-order structure) via a Vietoris-Rips filtration approximation at n=6 steps. (1) Betti-0 (connected components) per filtration step in n=6 stages, (2) n=6 Betti-0 resonance ratio, (3) death/birth ratio phi=2 resonance, (4) mean number-of-components n=6 resonance. n=6 link: Betti-number target = n = 6, persistence bar = sigma = 12, death/birth = phi = 2, filtration = tau = 4. Core metrics: `betti0_n6`, `bar_n6`, `death_birth_ratio`, `db_phi`, `ph_score`.
