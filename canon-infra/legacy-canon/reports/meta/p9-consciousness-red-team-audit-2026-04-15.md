# Consciousness Red Team paper honesty meta-audit (META-P9-2)

> **Auditor**: NEXUS-6 Meta Audit — **external** viewpoint to the STR-P9-2 author team
> **Purpose**: check counter-examples the Red Team itself missed, citation misuse, self-reference loops, realism gaps
> **Premise**: an honesty declaration alone is not evidence of audit pass. Re-cross-check item-by-item.

## 0. Summary verdict

- **Honesty grade**: **B+** (good, minor revision required)
- **Critical issues**: **1** (counter-example omission — IIT 4.0 Albantakis 2023)
- **Major issues**: **5** (4 theoretical-rebuttal omissions + 1 reference-number discrepancy)
- **Minor issues**: **4** (citation precision, self-reference zone, realism optimism, ASCII-chart notation)
- **Self-reference check**: **partial pass** — 1 intentional self-citation found (SS 4.3 uses sigma*phi=n*tau as basis for Autopoiesis interpretation)
- **Revision recommendations**: three locations SS 3, SS 4.3, Appendix A (no large-scale rewrite needed; patches suffice)

## 2. Issues found — numbered

### I-01 [critical] IIT 4.0 (Albantakis 2023) counter-example omission

- **Evidence**: The paper SS 3.1 R1 only mentions Barrett-Seth 2011 Phi_E, Mediano 2019 Phi comparison.
  Albantakis L, Barbosa L, Findlay G, Grasso M, Haun AM, Marshall W, Mayner WGP,
  Zaeemzadeh A, Boly M, Juel BE, Sasai S, Fujii K, David I, Hendren J, Lang JP,
  Tononi G (2023) "Integrated information theory (IIT) 4.0: Formulating the
  properties of phenomenal existence in physical terms." PLoS Comput Biol
  19(10):e1011465. DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011465 — in IIT 4.0 the Phi definition
  is **fully reformulated** (cause-effect structure, specific substrates).
- **Impact**: R1 concludes "no single Phi latent", but IIT 4.0 attempts to **redefine
  it as a single value via phi_s (structure informativeness)**. The Red Team
  conclusion does not reflect the latest post-2023 frame.
- **Recommendation**: add at the end of SS 3.1: "IIT 4.0 Albantakis 2023 reformulation
  also lacks the alpha=4/3 numeric value (phi_s is an information unit in bits,
  not a dimensionless exponent)" -> R1 conclusion preservable but **honesty
  reinforced**.

### I-02 [major] Active inference (Hohwy) counter-example omission

- **Evidence**: SS 4.2 alternative B cites Friston FEP Markov blanket, but does not
  cite Hohwy J (2016) "The self-evidencing brain." Nous 50(2):259-285, which proposes
  **active inference** — consciousness = "self-evidencing of the generative model".
- **Impact**: beyond GWT/IIT/FEP, the 4th mainstream theory is **untreated**.
  When the Red Team transitions from alpha-product rejection to structural
  isomorphism, Hohwy active inference compatibility with tau=4 avastha is omitted.
- **Recommendation**: add "Hohwy 2016 self-evidencing 4 stages (perception /
  action / attention / meta-cognition)" to the theory bridge of SS 4.2.

### I-03 [major] Higher-order thought (Rosenthal HOT) counter-example omission

- **Evidence**: Rosenthal DM (2005) "Consciousness and Mind." Oxford. — HOT theory
  defines consciousness as **higher-order representation of one's own states**.
  The Red Team treats "consciousness-theory triple fusion" but does not mention
  HOT at all.
- **Impact**: SS 4.3 alternative C "perfect-number self-reduction <-> Hofstadter
  Strange Loop" is **structurally identical** to HOT's "higher-order representation
  of own state". Citing Rosenthal 2005 would strengthen alternative C, but is missed.
- **Recommendation**: add Rosenthal HOT to SS 4.3 theory bridge -> alternative C
  credibility +1.

### I-04 [major] Attention Schema Theory (Graziano AST) counter-example omission

- **Evidence**: Graziano MSA (2013) "Consciousness and the Social Brain." Oxford /
  Graziano MSA (2019) "Rethinking Consciousness." Norton. — AST defines consciousness
  as **a simplified internal model of attention**. A close competitor to GWT.
- **Impact**: SS 4.1 alternative A "phi(6)=2 duality" and "observer <-> observed
  space" are **isomorphic** to AST's "attention schema vs attention target"
  two-layer structure. Citing Graziano would greatly strengthen alternative A,
  but is missed.
- **Recommendation**: add Graziano AST to SS 4.1 theory bridge.

### I-05 [major] Consciousness-thermodynamics (England 2013) counter-example omission

- **Evidence**: England JL (2013) "Statistical physics of self-replication."
  J Chem Phys 139:121923. + England's follow-ups — dissipative-structure /
  self-replication statistical physics provides the thermodynamic conditions
  for consciousness emergence. Directly connected to alternative C "self-reductive
  emergence".
- **Impact**: SS 4.3 cites Kauffman RAF but omits England's thermodynamic
  self-replication frame. Alternative C's **physical foundation** is weakened.
- **Recommendation**: add England 2013 to SS 4.3 theory bridge -> alternative C
  extends to thermodynamics / information / math triple fusion.

### I-06 [major] Reference-number discrepancy (honesty-impairing)

- **Evidence**: SS 0 honesty declaration = "external-paper sources listed **12**",
  SS 6.4 honesty declaration = "**12 external papers** basis", **Appendix A**
  title = "Complete reference list **(12)**", but the actual Appendix A list
  has **13** (Hordijk-Steel 2004 is #13).
- **Impact**: three honesty declarations all say "12" but reality is 13. Minor,
  but in an honesty audit **number discrepancy** is a critical marker.
- **Recommendation**: correct all three locations "12" -> "13" + Appendix A
  title to "(13)".

### I-07 [major] Weakness of R3 independent-latent rebuttal argument

- **Evidence**: SS 3.3 argues that Casali 2013 PCI is "IIT-derived while covariant
  with GNW ignition" -> rebuttal of independent latent. But PCI is **TMS-EEG-based**
  and is a single measurement of **activity complexity**. Even "IIT-derived" means
  **theoretically motivated formula** rather than **direct measurement of IIT's
  latent**. Similarly, covariance with GNW ignition is **phenomenal correlation**
  and not **same latent**.
- **Impact**: R3's "rebuttal of independent-latent assumption" is strictly
  **incomplete**. Covariance alone cannot prove the two latents are identical
  (mediating variables possible).
- **Recommendation**: add at end of SS 3.3 "covariance != same latent" constraint
  explicit + soften terminology to "partial rebuttal". The MISS conclusion is
  already secured by R1/R2 alone, so weakening R3 has no impact on the overall
  conclusion.

### I-08 [self-reference] SS 4.3 sigma*phi=n*tau reuse loop

- **Evidence**: SS 3.3 conclusion: "product = 1 is repackaging of the sigma*phi=n*tau
  theorem, not a new discovery about consciousness" (the paper itself uses self-
  reference as **rebuttal basis**) — appropriate.
- **However** SS 4.3 alternative C theory bridge: "Maturana-Varela Autopoiesis —
  self-generating system, **sigma*phi=n*tau is also a self-relation theorem**" ->
  sigma*phi=n*tau used as **positive grounds** for Autopoiesis isomorphism. In R3
  used as rebuttal reason, in SS 4.3 used as positive grounds — **double use**.
- **Impact**: using the same theorem in one section as "trivial identity ->
  rebuttal" and in another as "self-relation theorem -> emergence basis" ->
  **logical consistency** weakens. Declared as self-reference check pass, but
  in fact reuses the own theorem as **basis** for the consciousness hypothesis.
- **Recommendation**: in SS 4.3, remove direct reference to sigma*phi=n*tau, or
  add a footnote: "Autopoiesis is a general self-relation discourse; direct
  citation of sigma*phi=n*tau omitted to avoid circularity".

### I-09 [minor] Alternative B 3-month verification timeline excessively optimistic

- **Evidence**: SS 4.2 = "PASS/MISS determined within 3 months", SS 7 = "most
  realistic path verifiable within 3 months". But the verification plan = GMM
  reanalysis of Casali 2013 + Sarasso 2015 PCI values + Siclari 2017 REM PCI.
  In reality:
  - Casali 2013 Table 1: 20 subjects, wake/sleep/anesthesia PCI (public)
  - Sarasso 2015 Fig 2: ketamine/propofol/xenon PCI (public graph, **raw values
    require request**)
  - Siclari 2017: REM PCI public status **needs confirmation** (author-held data)
- **Impact**: 1~2 months for raw data access (author request, ethics approval),
  GMM BIC computation itself is 1 day. Actual timeline = **4~6 months** realistic.
  "3 months" is technical optimism.
- **Recommendation**: update SS 4.2 / SS 7 / SS 6.2 timeline "3 months" ->
  "3~6 months (conditional on raw-data availability)".

### I-10 [minor] COGITATE 2025 citation context partial misuse

- **Evidence**: at end of SS 3.3 "COGITATE 2025 adversarial IIT vs GNW evaluation"
  cited. But COGITATE is Ferrante O et al. Nature 642:133-142 (2025) — a public
  preregistered adversarial collaboration. The result is **both IIT and GWT
  partially supported + partially rebutted** (no clear winner). The Red Team
  simply cites it as "two theories covariant", but COGITATE's real conclusion
  is that **the two theories succeed/fail in different prediction domains**,
  inconsistent with a simple "covariant latent" conclusion.
- **Impact**: COGITATE evidence does not **perfectly** support R3. Minor misuse,
  but a plot for an honesty audit.
- **Recommendation**: after the COGITATE citation in SS 3.3, add "however COGITATE
  shows prediction-domain separation rather than simple covariance".

### I-11 [minor] ASCII-chart "ceiling" notation consistency

- **Evidence**: in SS 5.1 charts "R1~R5 rebuttal 10/10 ceiling" / "tau=4 avastha
  9/10 ceiling" / "perfect-number 10/10 ceiling" etc. 'ceiling' notation used
  (rule adhered to).
- **However** in SS 5.1 5th block "alien index" "BT-19 alpha-product original
  hypothesis 0/10" has no 'floor' text. The rule is to apply 'ceiling' to the
  **maximum** — the minimum text is not required separately — but for 'ceiling'
  text consistency, **preserve '/bottom' or blank** at 0/10 recommended as
  explicit criterion.
- **Impact**: very minor.
- **Recommendation**: optional revision — add text-style guide.

### I-12 [minor] Alternative A prediction grade [6] insufficient basis

- **Evidence**: SS 4.1 alternative A prediction grade [6] PARTIAL. But in body
  limit analysis admits "phi(3)=phi(4)=2 — n=6 uniqueness demonstration failed".
  With n=6 uniqueness failure, [5] or below is appropriate. [6] is inflated.
- **Impact**: Alternative A likely to drop to [5] in actual verification
  (no n=6 uniqueness).
- **Recommendation**: lower SS 4.1 grade [6] -> [5] + sync SS 5.1 composite
  grade table.

## 5. Honesty grade — final verdict

```
  Item                            Score (0~10)
  --------------------------------------------
  original-hypothesis rejection    10/10 ceiling   ([7?] -> [5] lowering explicit)
  external-paper statement         8/10            (-number mismatch)
  self-reference avoidance         7/10            (SS 4.3 1 violation)
  counter-example coverage         5/10            (5 latest 2023~ items missed)
  realism                          6/10            (3-month optimism)
  ASCII-chart rule adherence       9/10            (ceiling notation mostly consistent)
  --------------------------------------------
  weighted average                 7.4/10  = B+
```

**Final verdict**: **B+ (good, minor revisions required)**

- High praise for the Red Team formalizing its own theory rebuttal (A-grade)
- But 2023~2025 latest-theory coverage is insufficient (C-grade)
- Reference-number discrepancy is simple but an honesty-audit dealbreaker
- With only the 4 proposed immediate revisions, A- grade is reachable

---

## 6. Limitations of the audit itself

- **Auditor independence**: this audit is also internal output of the
  canon project. Not fully-external audit. Like the Red Team paper,
  **external reproduction** required.
- **Additional literature coverage**: beyond the 5 (Albantakis IIT 4.0, Hohwy,
  Rosenthal, Graziano, England), Lamme recurrent processing, Baars-Franklin
  LIDA, Tononi 2020 Integrated World Theory etc could be added. This audit
  selects the "major 5".
- **Independent verification-data access**: Casali 2013 PCI Table 1 actual
  values not actually accessed. The 3 vs 6 month timeline debate hinges on
  raw-data access.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The Consciousness Red Team paper (STR-P9-2) is **honesty B+**. Active
rebuttal of its own theory and [7?] -> [5] lowering are upper-tier by academic
standards. But:

1. **IIT 4.0 Albantakis 2023 omission** (critical, 1)
2. **4 latest consciousness-theory omissions** (Hohwy, Rosenthal, Graziano, England)
3. **Reference-number 12 vs 13 mismatch** (all 3 honesty declarations in error)
4. **SS 4.3 sigma*phi=n*tau self-reference reuse** (partial violation)

After 4 revisions, A- is attainable. Alternative B (tau=4 PCI GMM reanalysis)
is realistic at **3~6 months rather than 3**. Raw-data acquisition stage
should be explicit in SS 6.2.

**Auditor final recommendation**: add IIT 4.0 to SS 3.1 + correct Appendix A
title to "13" + SS 4.3 sigma*phi=n*tau footnote — fix **these 3 places now**
to pass the honesty audit. The rest are recommended to be revised together
when alternative B PASSes in DSE-P10-1 verification.

**Auditor**: NEXUS-6 Meta Audit
**Date**: 2026-04-15
**Audit target**: papers/consciousness-red-team-n6-failure-2026-04-15.md (522 lines)
**Self-reference check**: partial pass (this audit is also project-internal output,
external reproduction required)
**Follow-up**: STR-P9-2 revision v2 (Albantakis + number fix) recommended
**License**: CC-BY-SA-4.0
