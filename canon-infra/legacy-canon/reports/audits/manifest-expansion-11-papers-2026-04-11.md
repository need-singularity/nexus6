# papers manifest expansion audit — chunk_d 9 papers bulk registration (PP3 sync)

**Date**: 2026-04-11
**Type**: audit report (reports/audits)
**Scope**: new registration of the remaining 9 chunk_d papers in `$PAPERS/manifest.json`
**Operator**: Claude (Opus 4.6, 1M context) — papers manifest sync agent
**Prior audits**:
- `reports/audits/papers-expansion-39-50.md` (chunk_d 11 papers created, N6-046~056 id range)
- `reports/audits/papers-n62-completion-2026-04-11.md` (chunk_d 9 papers N62 completion, 291/291)
- `reports/audits/zenodo-publish-3-papers-2026-04-11.md` (N6-054/057/058 3 papers manifest registration)

---

## 0. Summary

`papers_chunk_d_2026-04-11` consists of 11 papers total, of which 2 (N6-054 cross-paradigm-ai, N6-057 ai-17-techniques) were registered in the manifest in prior sessions. N6-058 (synthetic-biology) originally belongs to `chunk_c` but was registered in the manifest during the same session and is pending publication. This audit **bulk-registers the 9 remaining chunk_d papers** (geology, meteorology, oceanography, curvature, warp, extra-dimensions, hexa-earphone, dimensional-unfolding, atlas-promotion) in `$PAPERS/manifest.json`. N62 re-verification shows all 9 papers reach `OSSIFIED: N/N (iter=1)` (total 291/291), JSON validity `python3 -m json.tool` PASS. `_meta.total_papers` moves 120 -> **129** (9 added; the task's "128" label was an off-by-one assuming "8 items to register" — actual remaining registration targets are 9).

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|--------|
| `_meta.total_papers` | 120 | **129** |
| `_meta.updated` | 2026-04-11 (maintained) | 2026-04-11 |
| manifest entries | 120 | **129** |
| New entries | — | 9 (N6-046~053, N6-055) |
| Existing entry changes | — | **0** (N6-054/057/058 and all others preserved) |

---

## 1. Registration targets: 9 papers (target id mapping)

While preserving the chunk_d 11-paper order, pre-registered N6-054/057 keep their "in-place" slot and the remaining 9 papers are assigned to N6-046~053, N6-055. (N6-056 is currently unused — reserved for follow-on expansion.)

| # | Order | Filename | id | BT | Korean title summary |
|---|---|--------|-----|-----|--------------|
| 1 | 1 | `papers/n6-geology-prem-paper.md` | **N6-046** | BT-372 | Earth interior PREM 6-layer |

| 9 | 11 | `papers/n6-atlas-promotion-7-to-10-paper.md` | **N6-055** | atlas-protocol | atlas [7]->[10*] promotion |

> **id allocation principle**: preserve chunk_d report order + keep pre-registered slots + allocate consecutive ordinals (skip N6-054/057; extra free slot N6-056).
> **N6-056**: currently unassigned. Reserved as a slot for follow-up chunk (e.g., chunk_e) or a continuation of the atlas-promotion paper.

## 3. manifest.json entry structure (common)

Follows the pattern of the existing N6-054 (chunk_d flagship) entry verbatim. Uses the `file` field (repo-relative path), not `source`. `tier: 2` (the 9 chunk_d papers are domain-expansion papers; only main-axis papers N6-054/057 are tier 1).

### 3.1 Field list (common for 9 papers)

```json
{
  "id": "N6-0XX",
  "title": "Perfect Number n=6 ... (English)",
  "repo": "canon",
  "file": "papers/n6-xxx-paper.md",
  "status": "Draft",
  "doi": "",
  "zenodo_doi": null,
  "osf_id": null,
  "date": "2026-04-11",
  "tier": 2,
  "keywords": ["perfect number", "n=6", "...", "..." (8 items)],
  "abstract_first_line": "...",
  "bts": "BT-...",
  "verify_status": "N/N OSSIFIED (iter=1)",
  "publish_ready": true,
  "publish_checklist_ref": "reports/audits/papers-n62-completion-2026-04-11.md#..."
}
```

### 3.2 English title generation principle

Each paper's body h1 (Korean) is translated directly to produce an English title for the Zenodo API `title` field. Examples:

| id | Korean h1 | English title (manifest) |
|----|--------|--------------------|
| N6-046 | Perfect number n=6 and Earth's internal structure: arithmetic origins of the PREM 6-layer partition | Perfect Number n=6 and the Layered Structure of the Earth: Arithmetic Origins of the PREM Six-Layer Model |
| N6-047 | Perfect number n=6 and atmospheric science: arithmetic structure of meteorology | Perfect Number n=6 and Atmospheric Science: Arithmetic Structure of Meteorology |
| N6-048 | Perfect number n=6 and oceanography: arithmetic structure of currents, layers, and salinity | Perfect Number n=6 and Oceanography: Arithmetic Structure of Currents, Layers, and Salinity |
| N6-049 | Perfect number n=6 and Riemann curvature: arithmetic parameterization of general relativity | Perfect Number n=6 and Riemann Curvature: Arithmetic Parameterization of General Relativity |
| N6-050 | Perfect number n=6 and warp metrics: arithmetic parameterization of Alcubierre, wormhole, Casimir | Perfect Number n=6 and Warp Metrics: Arithmetic Parameterization of Alcubierre, Wormholes, and Casimir Geometry |
| N6-051 | Perfect number n=6 and extra dimensions: arithmetic structure of Calabi-Yau, Kaluza-Klein, M-theory | Perfect Number n=6 and Extra Dimensions: Arithmetic Structure of Calabi-Yau, Kaluza-Klein, and M-Theory |
| N6-052 | Perfect number n=6 and earphone chip design: arithmetic parameterization of drivers, codecs, filters | Perfect Number n=6 and Earphone Chip Design: Arithmetic Parameterization of Drivers, Codecs, and Filters |
| N6-053 | Perfect number n=6 and dimensional unfolding breakthrough: triple path of tensor, mod-3, log-spectrum | Perfect Number n=6 and Dimensional Unfolding: Triple Path of Tensor, mod-3, and Log-Spectrum |
| N6-055 | Perfect number n=6 and atlas promotion: [7] EMPIRICAL -> [10*] EXACT systematic promotion | Atlas Promotion [7] EMPIRICAL -> [10*] EXACT: A Systematic Protocol for Reality-Map Ossification under n=6 |

> The English title is subject to user review/editing at Zenodo upload time (the manifest value is a draft).

### 3.3 keywords (8 per paper)

All papers share `perfect number`, `n=6` + 6 domain-specific keywords. Example (N6-046):
```
["perfect number", "n=6", "geology", "PREM", "Earth interior",
 "lithosphere", "mantle", "BT-372"]
```

### 3.4 bts field (BT range string)

- Single BT: `"BT-372"` (N6-046 geology)
- Multiple BTs: `"BT-378,BT-351,BT-352,BT-353,BT-354,BT-355,BT-356,BT-357,BT-358,BT-359,BT-360"` (N6-050 warp)
- Protocol: `"atlas-protocol"` (N6-055 atlas promotion)

## 4. `_meta` update

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "description": "Papers manifest — all published/draft papers across repos",
    "updated": "2026-04-11",
    "schema_version": "1.0",
    "total_papers": 129
  }
}
```

| Field | Before | After |
|------|--------|--------|
| `total_papers` | 120 | **129** (+9) |
| `updated` | 2026-04-11 | 2026-04-11 (maintained) |
| `schema_version` | 1.0 | 1.0 (maintained) |

---

## 5. JSON validity check

```sh
/usr/bin/python3 -m json.tool $PAPERS/manifest.json > /dev/null && echo "PASS"
```

Result: **PASS** (no syntax errors, trailing newline preserved, UTF-8 NFKC).

Additional check (count after load):

```python
import json
d = json.load(open('$PAPERS/manifest.json'))
assert d['_meta']['total_papers'] == 129
assert len(d['papers']) == 129
assert all(p.get('id') for p in d['papers'])
```

-> all PASS.

---

## 6. Existing entry preservation check

At the start of this audit, a serialization snapshot was taken for N6-054, N6-057, N6-058, and after the update the snapshots were re-compared to confirm **0 changes**.

- N6-054: `verify_status: "39/39 OSSIFIED (iter=1)"` maintained
- N6-057: `verify_status: "40/40 OSSIFIED (iter=1)"` maintained
- N6-058: `verify_status: "79/79 OSSIFIED (iter=1)"` maintained

```python
fixed_ids = {"N6-054", "N6-057", "N6-058"}
snapshot_before = {p["id"]: json.dumps(p, sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)
                   for p in manifest["papers"] if p["id"] in fixed_ids}
# ... append new entries ...
snapshot_after = {p["id"]: json.dumps(p, sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)
                  for p in manifest["papers"] if p["id"] in fixed_ids}
assert snapshot_before == snapshot_after, "fixed entries modified"
```

-> PASS.

## 7. PP3 (manifest SSOT) compliance

PP3 rule: **an entry must exist in `$PAPERS/manifest.json` before Zenodo publishing**.

After this audit completes, **all** 11 chunk_d papers are registered in the manifest:

| id | Registration time | Session |
|----|---------|-----|
| N6-046 | **2026-04-11 (this session)** | manifest expansion agent |
| N6-047 | **2026-04-11 (this session)** | manifest expansion agent |
| N6-048 | **2026-04-11 (this session)** | manifest expansion agent |
| N6-049 | **2026-04-11 (this session)** | manifest expansion agent |
| N6-050 | **2026-04-11 (this session)** | manifest expansion agent |
| N6-051 | **2026-04-11 (this session)** | manifest expansion agent |
| N6-052 | **2026-04-11 (this session)** | manifest expansion agent |
| N6-053 | **2026-04-11 (this session)** | manifest expansion agent |
| N6-054 | 2026-04-11 | zenodo 3-paper agent |
| N6-055 | **2026-04-11 (this session)** | manifest expansion agent |
| N6-057 | 2026-04-11 | zenodo 3-paper agent |

**chunk_d registration completeness**: 11/11 = **100%**. Full PP3 sync.

(`N6-056` is not allocated within chunk_d -> 10 of 11 slots used, reserved for follow-on expansion.)

## 8. Publication readiness summary

| Paper | verify_status | publish_ready | Next step |
|------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| N6-046 geology | 32/32 OSSIFIED | true | Zenodo upload pending |
| N6-047 meteorology | 31/31 OSSIFIED | true | Zenodo upload pending |
| N6-048 oceanography | 28/28 OSSIFIED | true | Zenodo upload pending |
| N6-049 curvature | 35/35 OSSIFIED | true | Zenodo upload pending |
| N6-050 warp | 25/25 OSSIFIED | true | Zenodo upload pending |
| N6-051 extra-dim | 31/31 OSSIFIED | true | Zenodo upload pending |
| N6-052 earphone | 34/34 OSSIFIED | true | Zenodo upload pending |
| N6-053 dim-unfolding | 39/39 OSSIFIED | true | Zenodo upload pending |
| N6-055 atlas-promo | 36/36 OSSIFIED | true | Zenodo upload pending |

**Publication ready 9/9**. The user can, after setting `ZENODO_TOKEN`, run `upload_zenodo.sh N6-046` ~ `N6-055` sequentially to issue 9 DOIs. This agent is forbidden from calling the API (carrying over prior-session policy).

**N62 incomplete**: 0/9. No papers deferred in this cycle.

---

## 9. Task summary table

| Step | Command/file | Result |
|------|---------|------|
| 1. Read prior reports | `papers-expansion-39-50.md`, `papers-n62-completion-2026-04-11.md`, `zenodo-publish-3-papers-2026-04-11.md` | 11 files + BT mapping confirmed |
| 2. Verify `_registry.json` chunk_d | `papers/_registry.json` L24~L96 | 11-paper list + bt_mapping confirmed |
| 3. N62 re-run | `/tmp/n62-verify/verify_all.py` | 9/9 OSSIFIED (291/291) |
| 4. Metadata extraction | each md h1 + abstract first line | 9-paper draft confirmed |
| 5. Write 9 entries | `/tmp/n62-verify/new_entries.json` | JSON array of 9 items |
| 6. Merge into manifest | `/tmp/n62-verify/update_manifest.py` | 120 -> 129, fixed preserved |
| 7. JSON validity | `python3 -m json.tool` | PASS |
| 8. English report | this file | recorded in `reports/audits/` |

---

## 10. Rule compliance check

- [x] **R14**: directly edit `$PAPERS/manifest.json` SSOT (no duplicate new file created)
- [x] **R18**: minimal scope — only the 9-paper manifest registration, no body edits / hexa creation / incidental work
- [x] **R25**: shared-settings gate — this work is within GO mode, proceeded after reviewing `canonshared/rules/common.json`
- [x] **English required**: this report body is English, English is confined to the Zenodo API payload `title` field
- [x] **HEXA-FIRST**: no new .py/.hexa created. Temporary verification helpers (`/tmp/n62-verify/*.py`) are outside the repo
- [x] **PP1 (CC-BY 4.0)**: all 9 papers explicitly note (confirmed in prior audit)
- [x] **PP2 (N62 embed)**: all 9 papers re-executed via `/usr/bin/python3` in this session and PASS
- [x] **PP3 (manifest SSOT)**: this audit completes chunk_d 11/11
- [x] **Existing entries immutable**: N6-054/057/058 snapshot check PASS

---

## 11. Follow-up

1. **Zenodo upload** (user manual): run `upload_zenodo.sh N6-046` ~ `N6-055` sequentially 9 times -> 9 DOIs issued
2. **manifest DOI sync**: enter the issued DOIs into each entry's `doi` + `zenodo_doi` fields, and flip `status`: Draft -> Published
3. **`papers/_registry.json` sync**: promote `papers_chunk_d_2026-04-11.status` from "Draft" -> "Published (11/11)"
4. **chunk_e follow-up**: once the domain papers (excluding atlas-promotion) are published, the N6-056 slot can be allocated to a new paper (e.g., BT-541~547 millennium sub-decomposition)
5. **English title review**: the English title drafted in this audit is at draft level. User final review recommended at Zenodo upload time

---

## 12. Conclusion

**Bulk registration of the remaining 9 papers (N6-046~053, N6-055) of `papers_chunk_d_2026-04-11` in `$PAPERS/manifest.json`** is complete. N62 re-verification 9/9 PASS (**291/291 OSSIFIED**), JSON validity PASS, `_meta.total_papers` 120 -> **129**, existing N6-054/057/058 entries fully preserved (snapshot check passed). Under the PP3 rule, all chunk_d entries are in the manifest and ready for immediate upload to the Zenodo REST API `deposit/depositions` endpoint.

Actual DOI issuance is performed by the user by setting `ZENODO_TOKEN` and running `upload_zenodo.sh <id>` 9 times sequentially. This agent observes the API-call-forbidden policy. In a follow-up session, once DOIs are received, `status`: Draft -> Published can be updated and `papers/_registry.json` synced.
