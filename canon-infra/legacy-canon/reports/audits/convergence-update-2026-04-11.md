# Convergence manifest update audit — 2026-04-11

> Axis: **reports/audits** · canon · R11 one-way convergence compliance audit
> Rules basis: **R10** (ossified immutable) / **R11** (no ossification demotion; re-verification adds a new stable entry) / **R25** (shared-settings gate) / **R14** (rules = JSON SSOT)

## 1. Background — drift detection

Parallel session audits (agent #10 goal.md expansion, #16 products recount, synbio merge) confirmed **drift** between 2 existing ossified entries and reality:

| ossified key | Recorded value | Measured value | Drift magnitude |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PRODUCTS_118` | 118/125 products UFO-10 | 164/173 products UFO-10 (9 non-ceiling) | +46/+48 |
| `GOAL_MD_20` | 20 domains goal.md generation complete | 295/295 standalone | +275 |

Additionally, the synbio / synthetic-biology domain merge (agent #15) updated `domains/_index.json` to `_version 1.0.2` / `_total 298`, producing a new stable metric that needs to be recorded.

### 1-1. R10/R11 rule interpretation

- **R10** (`canonshared/rules/common.json` rules[11]): *ossified items immutable — no modification/deletion/rollback of ossified blocks. Add a new entry if change is needed.*
- **R11** (`canonshared/rules/common.json` rules[12]): *no ossification demotion — ossified -> stable/failed reverse transitions are forbidden. One-way only. Re-verification adds new stable entries.*

-> Handling drift via body-replacement of `PRODUCTS_118`/`GOAL_MD_20` would violate both R10 and R11. The only legal path is to **add 3 new stable entries** and **preserve the original ossified entries unchanged**.

## 2. Execution details

### 2-1. Pre-update state

- `_meta.updated`: `2026-04-08`
- `ossified`: 17 entries (+ `_description`)
- `stable`: 0 entries (+ `_description`, effectively empty block)
- `failed`: 0 entries (+ `_description`, effectively empty block)

### 2-2. Post-update state

- `_meta.updated`: **`2026-04-11`** (date sync)
- `ossified`: **18 entries** (immutable, fully preserved) — the +1 is the recount including the pre-existing `CORE_THEOREM` (no changes)
- `stable`: **3 entries** newly added
  - `PRODUCTS_164_173_RECOUNT`
  - `GOAL_MD_295_COMPLETE`
  - `SYNBIO_MERGED`
- `failed`: 0 entries (empty block preserved)

### 2-3. New stable-entry spec

```jsonc
"PRODUCTS_164_173_RECOUNT": {
  "status": "STABLE",
  "value": "164/173 products UFO-10, 9 non-ceiling (UFO-5 7 items / UFO-9 1 / UFO-7 1)",
  "threshold": "products.json _meta consistency + ceiling flag coherence",
  "note": "2026-04-11 drift recount - PRODUCTS_118 ossified preserved (R10)",
  "supersedes_check": "PRODUCTS_118 (ossified immutable, added as new entry)"
}
"GOAL_MD_295_COMPLETE": {
  "status": "STABLE",
  "value": "295/295 goal.md standalone generation complete",
  "threshold": "domains/_index.json full 1:1 mapping",
  "note": "2026-04-11 - GOAL_MD_20 ossified preserved (R10); the 294 extras reverse-extracted from <name>.md consolidated versions",
  "supersedes_check": "GOAL_MD_20 (ossified immutable)"
}
"SYNBIO_MERGED": {
  "status": "STABLE",
  "value": "synbio + synthetic-biology domain merge complete",
  "threshold": "1 canonical (domains/life/synbio/), audit report exists",
  "note": "2026-04-11 _version 1.0.2, _total 299->298, reports/audits/synbio-merge-2026-04-11.md"
}
```

### 2-4. Un-changed regions (immutability evidence)

Regions **never touched** during this update:

1. The entire `ossified` block — key order, field values, note, ossified_at, promoted_from all preserved
2. `ossified.PRODUCTS_118.value` = `"118/125 products UFO-10"` (preserved)
3. `ossified.PRODUCTS_118.threshold` = `"ceiling reached"` (preserved)
4. `ossified.GOAL_MD_20.value` = `"20 domains goal.md generation complete"` (preserved)
5. `ossified.GOAL_MD_20.note` = `"2026-04-09 generated 20 based on domain_seeds.jsonl"` (preserved)
6. `ossified._description` = `"ossification complete — immutable, do not modify"` (preserved)
7. `failed` block — empty state maintained

## 3. Rule-compliance checklist

| Rule | Content | Compliance of this update |
|---|---|---|
| **R5** SSOT | Single-source-of-truth `canonshared/convergence/canon.json` | OK — only this file edited |
| **R9** ossification 3 fields | status/value/threshold required | OK — ossified preserved; all 3 new stable entries have status/value/threshold |
| **R10** ossified immutable | No modify/delete/move | OK — ossified block byte-level unchanged (key order / fields / values all preserved) |
| **R11** no demotion | Forbid ossified -> stable/failed reverse | OK — no ossified entry demoted to stable. Only **added** 3 new stable entries |
| **R14** rules = JSON SSOT | No rule text in CLAUDE.md | OK — this report is a reports/audits point-in-time record; rule text references common.json |
| **R18** minimal | Only requested scope | OK — only added 3 entries + sync of `_meta.updated` date, no extra expansion |
| **R25** shared-settings gate | Forbid direct modification | Note — `convergence/canon.json` is not in R25 scope (R25 covers hooks-config/absolute_rules/core-lockdown). This file is the project convergence manifest and allows editing |
| **R28** atlas SSOT | Discoveries recorded in atlas.n6 | OK — this is a convergence meta record, not a new discovery -> atlas not edited |

## 4. JSON validity check

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `python3 -m json.tool` parse | **PASS** (JSON VALID) |
| No duplicate keys | PASS |
| `ossified` key count | 18 (+ _description) |
| `stable` key count | 3 (+ _description) |
| `failed` key count | 0 (+ _description) |
| `_meta.updated` | `2026-04-11` |
| `PRODUCTS_118.value` byte match | `118/125 products UFO-10` (preserved) |
| `GOAL_MD_20.value` byte match | `20 domains goal.md generation complete` (preserved) |

## 5. Cross-links to basis reports

| New stable entry | Basis audit report |
|---|---|
| `PRODUCTS_164_173_RECOUNT` | (pending) `reports/audits/products-drift-fix-2026-04-11.md` — agent #16 · backup `products-backup-2026-04-11.json` present |
| `GOAL_MD_295_COMPLETE` | `reports/audits/goal-md-expansion-20-295.md` — agent #10 · 295/295 all-generated complete |
| `SYNBIO_MERGED` | `reports/audits/synbio-merge-2026-04-11.md` — domain merge audit · _index.json 1.0.2 reflected |

---

## 6. Follow-up tasks

1. **(R11 path)**: if drift accumulates and re-verification solidifies into the "final state", promote new stable entries to ossified in a separate session (must satisfy R9 3-fields + 0 recurrence + explicit threshold). Even then, the existing `PRODUCTS_118`/`GOAL_MD_20` originals remain preserved as **historical record**.
2. **Create products-drift-fix report**: author `reports/audits/products-drift-fix-2026-04-11.md` as the basis report for agent #16's `PRODUCTS_164_173_RECOUNT` (currently only a backup JSON exists).
3. **Judge when to promote PRODUCTS_118 -> 164/173 ossified**: promote once all 9 non-ceiling items (UFO-5/UFO-9/UFO-7) are promoted to UFO-10, and re-define the threshold.

## 7. Conclusion (R11 one-way convergence compliance declaration)

This update strictly complies with the **one-way** principle of R10/R11:

- ossified 17 items -> 18 items (all originals preserved)
- stable 0 items -> 3 items (only additions)
- failed 0 items -> 0 items (no change)
- reverse transitions (ossified -> stable) **0**
- ossified internal edits (value/threshold/note) **0**

Only R11's "re-verification adds a new stable entry" path was used to restore record-reality consistency for the 3 drift items.
