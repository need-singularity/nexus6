# TECS-L Reference Cleanup Audit Report

**Date**: 2026-04-11
**Work**: Full audit and cleanup of residual TECS-L references in canon after TECS-L retirement

---

## Background

The TECS-L repo was retired, with its math + industrial functions fully absorbed into canon.
This cleanup scanned the entire project to remove active references and preserve historical records.

## Preserved Historical Records (Unmodified)

- `reports/` all: session records, discovery records, audit records
- `papers/` all: academic paper citations (author TECS-L Research Group, etc.)
- `canonshared/logs/absorbed/`: absorption log JSON
- `domains/*/.growth/absorbed/`: per-domain absorption records
- `nexus/origins/ready-absorber/findings/`: absorber exploration results
- `nexus/origins/ready-absorber/state.json`: absorption-complete state
- `nexus/origins/ready-absorber/phase2_state.json`: phase-2 absorption state
- `nexus/origins/ready-absorber/verified/`: verification results
- `nexus/origins/ready-absorber/top_critical_report.md`: critical tools report
- `theory/flow/tecs-l-bridge.md`: bridge document (legacy markers preserved)
- `theory/flow/alien-design-flow.md`: design flow document (history)
- `theory/breakthroughs/bt-candidates-from-tecs-l.md`: BT candidate record
- `theory/breakthroughs/bt-candidates-round2.md`: BT 2nd candidate record
- `theory/constants/atlas-constants.md`: TECS-L source note within constants record

## Remaining Active References: 0

All references in active code/config/commands targeting TECS-L have been removed or updated.
Only references in history/audit/papers are preserved (intentional).

---

## Notes

- `nexus/src/telescope/tecs_lenses.rs`: already unregistered in `mod.rs` (commented out). Will be deleted collectively in the lens-to-HEXA conversion.
- 32 files under `domains/` still contain "TECS-L" strings, but all are descriptive references (academic citation, cross-reference explanation) without active references to ~/Dev/ paths.
- `domains/compute/ai-efficiency/ai-efficiency.md` has a github URL reference, but kept in academic citation context.
