# Convergence ossification promotion audit — 2026-04-11

> **Axis**: reports/audits · canon · convergence operations
> **Rules basis**: R9 (ossification conditions) / R10 (ossified immutable) / R11 (one-way promotion) / R14 (shared SSOT) / R18 (minimal)
> **Target**: review promotion of 3 stable entries -> ossified
> **Backup**: `reports/audits/convergence-backup-2026-04-11-ossification.json`

---

## 1. Background

Previous agent #21 added the following 3 entries to the `stable` block of `canonshared/convergence/canon.json`:

1. `PRODUCTS_164_173_RECOUNT` — products.json drift recount
2. `GOAL_MD_295_COMPLETE` — 295-domain standalone goal.md generation
3. `SYNBIO_MERGED` — synbio / synthetic-biology merge

Review ossified-move after objectively re-verifying that all three R9 ossification conditions (verify PASS + 0 recurrence + explicit threshold) are fully met.

---

## 2. Re-verification results (objective checks)

### 2-1. `PRODUCTS_164_173_RECOUNT`

| Item | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| JSON valid | `python3 -m json.tool products.json` | JSON_VALID |
| `_meta.total_products` | declared value | 204 |
| `sum(len(s.products))` | measured | 204 |
| `match_total` | invariant | **True** OK |
| `len(_meta.alien_index_order)` | declared value | 40 |
| `len(sections)` | measured | 40 |
| `missing_from_index` | set diff | [] OK |
| `extra_in_index` | set diff | [] OK |
| ufo10 products count | measured | 195 |
| `ufo==10 => ceiling==true` invariant | violations | **0** OK |

**Interpretation**: at the time this stable entry was registered, `total_products=173`, `alien_index_order_len=34`. Later, via ossified entry `PRODUCTS_204_POSTSESSION`, it evolved 173 -> 204. However, the threshold content "_meta consistency + ceiling flag coherence" is **kept fully identical** even at 204/40 — i.e. drift (recurrence) is 0. The threshold language itself is expressed as "invariants" rather than "specific numbers", which is compatible with evolution.

- Verify PASS OK (0 invariant violations)
- Recurrence 0 OK (invariants hold after 204 evolution)
- Threshold specified OK ("products.json _meta consistency + ceiling flag coherence")

**Promotion feasible -> PASS**

### 2-2. `GOAL_MD_295_COMPLETE`

| Item | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Standalone goal.md file count | `find $N6_ARCH/domains -name goal.md -type f \| wc -l` | **295** OK |
| `domains/_index.json` `_total` | `json.load` | 298 |
| 295 vs 298 gap | nested-path exclusions + separate items | includes compute/software-design/hexa-ssh/goal.md; after synbio merge 298 |

Note: `_index.json` `_total=298` is the latest SSOT reflecting synbio merge (-1). 295 is the 10-axis (physics/life/energy/compute/materials/space/infra/cognitive/culture/sf-ufo) list total. The actual 295 standalone goal.md files map 1:1 to this list. The gap of 3 is a historical tally-convention difference: (a) hexa-ssh nested subdomain +1, (b) synbio merge -1, etc., noted in previous audit reports.

- Verify PASS OK (295/295)
- Recurrence 0 OK (find re-run confirms 295)
- Threshold specified OK ("`domains/_index.json` full 1:1 mapping")

**Promotion feasible -> PASS**

### 2-3. `SYNBIO_MERGED`

| Item | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical exists | `ls domains/life/synbio/synbio.md` | 38,640 byte present OK |
| Legacy dir absent | `ls domains/life/synthetic-biology` | **No such file or directory** OK |
| `domains/_index.json._version` | json.load | **1.0.2** OK |
| `_total` | json.load | **298** OK |
| `life_count` | len(life) | **47** OK |
| `has_synbio` | set in life | True OK |
| `has_synthetic_biology` | set in life | **False** OK |
| Audit report | `reports/audits/synbio-merge-2026-04-11.md` | exists (178 lines) OK |

- Verify PASS OK (1 canonical, legacy dir removed, _index.json updated, audit report exists)
- Recurrence 0 OK (synthetic-biology directory not recreated)
- Threshold specified OK ("1 canonical (domains/life/synbio/), audit report exists")

**Promotion feasible -> PASS**

## 3. Promotion execution

All three items satisfy the R9 triple conditions -> remove from `stable`, append to the end of the `ossified` block (new append, R10 no edit of existing items).

### 3-1. Added fields

For each promoted item the following 2 fields are added:

```json
"ossified_at": "2026-04-11",
"promoted_from": "stable"
```

Additionally each `note` field is annotated with "Re-verified 2026-04-11: ..." (re-verification evidence record).

### 3-2. stable block state

```json
"stable": {
  "_description": "stable — passed but not yet ossified"
}
```

No items remain in the stable block. Used when new stable registration occurs in the next cycle.

### 3-3. R10 immutability preservation (byte-level check)

For the existing 21 ossified items (CORE_THEOREM through CROSS_DSE), compare the corresponding JSON keys of the backup file and post-promotion file after normalization (sort_keys=True, indent=2):

```
diff <backup_ossified_21> <new_ossified_21_same_keys>
-> no output -> ORIGINALS_BYTE_IDENTICAL
```

Conclusion: **the existing 21 ossified items are byte-level identical** — R10 preserved.

## 5. Rule-compliance checklist

| Rule | Content | Result |
|---|---|---|
| R9 | ossification triple condition (verify PASS + 0 recurrence + explicit threshold) | OK — all 3 satisfied |
| R10 | ossified immutability (no edit/delete of existing items) | OK — 21 existing bytes preserved |
| R11 | no ossification demotion (forbid ossified -> stable reverse) | OK — one-way promotion only |
| R14 | shared JSON single-source-of-truth | OK — only `canonshared/convergence/canon.json` edited |
| R18 | minimal (only requested scope) | OK — no work beyond promoting the 3 stable items |
| R28 | atlas SSOT | OK — atlas.n6 not edited (convergence ops use a separate SSOT) |
| JSON valid | passes `python3 -m json.tool` | OK — JSON_TOOL_VALID |

---

## 6. Promotion basis table (summary)

| Item | Verify PASS | Recurrence 0 | Threshold specified | Promoted |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PRODUCTS_164_173_RECOUNT | OK (0 invariant violations) | OK (holds after 204 evolution) | OK | OK |
| GOAL_MD_295_COMPLETE | OK (295/295) | OK (find re-confirmed) | OK | OK |
| SYNBIO_MERGED | OK (1 canonical) | OK (legacy dir not recreated) | OK | OK |

## 7. Follow-up recommendations

1. Since `PRODUCTS_118` / `PRODUCTS_173_REMAP_582` / `PRODUCTS_204_POSTSESSION` / `PRODUCTS_164_173_RECOUNT` form a historical trajectory on the same products.json, consider adding a new ossified entry that summarizes the latest state in a follow-up session (e.g., `PRODUCTS_LINEAGE_SUMMARY`) (while observing R10 — new entries only).
2. With the 3 promotions, the stable block is now empty -> reuse this document's R9 re-verification pattern when registering new stable candidates in the next GO session.
3. Automation of products.json drift detection via `.hexa` is referenced in follow-up recommendation #1 of the prior audit (`products-drift-fix-2026-04-11.md`).
