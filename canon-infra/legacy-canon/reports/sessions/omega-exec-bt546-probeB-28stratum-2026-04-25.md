## 0. Non-claim disclaimer

This run does **NOT** prove (A3) (the conjectural lim_{B->inf} Cov(|Sel_2|, |Sel_3|) = 0).
This run does **NOT** resolve BSD or any of the 7 Millennium problems.
This run does **NOT** promote any atlas entry.
No state/inventory/atlas files are touched.
This is a single empirical measurement (28-cell joint covariance) on a finite Cremona slice; bootstrap SE is reported per cell; the "torsion x |Sha|" stratification is an ad-hoc diagnostic, not a proof technique.

The hypothesis being tested (kappa concentrates on Z/6 + Z/12 strata) and its falsifier (kappa > 0.5 uniformly on all 28 cells) are themselves diagnostic instruments, not assertions about asymptotic behaviour.

The 332k figure in the spec corresponds to conductors 1..49999 (5 shards). The local checkout has 27 shards (1..269999), giving N_total = **1,705,824** curves once parsed via the existing `parse()` -> `(N, r, t, sha)` pipeline. The probe was run on the full 27-shard set rather than artificially restricting to the original 5; this is documented and the implications are noted under "Anomalies" below.

### 1.2 Tool inspection

`scripts/empirical/cremona_joint_covariance.py` reads each shard line, extracts `(N, rank r, torsion order t, Sha analytic order)` via the layout

```
N label num eqn rank ord_T t omega L^(r)/r! R Sha
```

then computes `|Sel_2|` and `|Sel_3|` via the first-order approximations

```
|Sel_2| = 2^r * (2 if t even else 1) * 2-part(Sha)
|Sel_3| = 3^r * (3 if t%3==0 else 1) * 3-part(Sha)
```

(see lines 31-48 of the original tool). The pre-existing main path emits a single global Cov(|Sel_2|, |Sel_3|) = 1.333 with no bootstrap or per-stratum split. Two issues required addressing:

1. The hardcoded `ROOT = Path("~/core/canon")` does not exist in this checkout. Robust path resolution was added.
2. No bootstrap convention exists in the pre-existing tool. Spec said "match existing convention", but since none exists, the fresh `--per-stratum` mode introduces N = 1000 bootstrap as specified in the parent probe-B definition.

### 1.3 Patch scope

A new mode `--per-stratum`:

- streams pairs `(s2_i, s3_i, t_i, sha_i)` once,
- partitions into 28 cells by `(t in {1,2,3,4,6,8,12}) x (sha_class in {1, 4, 9, >9})`,
- per cell: computes kappa = Cov(|Sel_2|, |Sel_3|) and a 1000-bootstrap SE + 95% percentile interval (numpy fast path with pure-Python fallback),
- emits a JSON document on stdout with one row per cell.

The original global-kappa path is unchanged.

The global-kappa code path is untouched; running the script with no flags reproduces the legacy behaviour, including the historical write to `data/cremona/joint_covariance_A3_prime.json`.

- **Not significantly different from 0:** 0/19
- **Thin (N < 100):** 9/28 (4 of which are exactly 0 because cells are too small for nontrivial bootstrap)
- **Empty:** 3/28 (Z/8 sha>9, Z/12 sha=9, Z/12 sha>9)

## 5. Analysis

### 5.1 Hypothesis test: "kappa concentrates on Z/6 + Z/12 strata"

| Strata family               | Cells with N>=100 | Cell-level kappa values         | Largest |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------|
| Z/6 (t=6)                   | 2 of 4            | {+6.30, +5.13}                  | +6.30   |
| Z/12 (t=12)                 | 0 of 4            | (only t=12,sha=1 has N=88 -> thin) | n/a     |
| Other torsion strata        | 17 of 20          | spread from -23.4 to +4.45      | +4.45 (t=3,sha=1) |

**Concentration is partial, not exclusive.** Z/6 cells indeed achieve the **largest positive per-cell kappa** observed in the entire 28-cell table (kappa = +6.30 at t=6, sha=1; +5.13 at t=6, sha=4); this directionally supports the spec hypothesis. **However:**

1. Z/12 cells are essentially absent from the data. The single non-empty cell (t=12, sha=1) has N=88 < 100, falling below the statistical threshold; its kappa = +2.96 is not extreme.
2. The Z/3 sha=1 cell is **the third-largest per-cell kappa** at +4.45 with N = 30,094, well above noise; this is **not** a Z/6-line cell. The Z/3 stratum is on the "Z/3 line" of Mazur, not the Z/6 line.
3. The Z/2 sha=1 cell is +3.53 with N = 604,153; trivial-torsion sha=1 (Z/1) is +2.87 with N = 865,927. These two cells together hold 86% of all curves and contribute ~98% of the global kappa(B) = 1.333 weighted average.

The "exclusive concentration on Z/6 + Z/12" reading of the original hypothesis is **not supported**. A weakened reading -- "the largest per-cell kappa values appear on Z/6, consistent with sigma(6) = 12 cycle" -- is supported, but it does not rule out alternative carriers (especially the rank-mediated explanation: trivial-torsion sha=1 cells dominate by sheer volume, and within them rank > 0 curves drive both Sel_2 and Sel_3 jointly large).

### 5.2 Falsifier test: "kappa > 0.5 uniformly on all 28 cells"

| Among 19 cells with N >= 100 | Count |
|------------------------------|-------|
| kappa > 0.5                  | 13    |
| 0 < kappa <= 0.5             | 2     |
| kappa < 0                    | 4     |

**Falsifier NOT triggered.** The cell (t=1, sha=4) has kappa = +0.292 with SE = 0.009 (so kappa is strictly < 0.5 with overwhelming confidence). The cell (t=4, sha=9) has kappa = +0.249. Furthermore, four cells (one per torsion in {1,2,3,4} all with sha_class=>9) carry **strongly negative** kappa values, with magnitudes -7 to -23 in the well-populated cells. The hypothesis "kappa > 0.5 uniformly" is therefore **definitively rejected** by 6 of 19 cells.

This falsifier rejection is the central finding of the run: it eliminates the "height-normalization (Bhargava-Shankar) carries the entire 7/40 exponent" reading of the global-kappa signal. Per the parent BSD direction report (line 53, dfs-24-bsd-direction-2026-04-24.md), the Sel_6 = sigma line therefore **does not weaken** under this probe; the alternative is left open.

### 5.3 Unexpected concentration: large negative kappa on sha_class > 9

The four cells `(t in {1,2,3,4}, sha_class=>9)` all carry strongly negative kappa with statistical significance (kappa + 2*se < 0). This is mechanistically unsurprising once the construction of the toy |Sel_n| is understood:

```
|Sel_2| ~ 2^r * tf2 * 2-part(Sha),   |Sel_3| ~ 3^r * tf3 * 3-part(Sha)
```

Within a fixed-rank, fixed-torsion subpopulation, a curve with very large analytic |Sha| typically has its 2-power-decomposition concentrated either in 2-part or in 3-part, not both (the multiplicative split is "at most one large factor at a time" in these conductor ranges). Hence Sel_2 large -> Sel_3 small, producing anti-correlation. This is a real signal but it is a property of the **first-order Sel_n approximation**, not of true Selmer ranks; the original tool's caveat list ("|Sel_n| first-order approximation") applies and the negative kappa here should not be over-interpreted.

### 5.4 Top-2 dominant cells (signed contribution to global kappa)

Ranked by `|kappa * N_cell|`:

| rank | torsion | sha_class | N_cell  | kappa    | se     | contribution = kappa * N |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|--------------------------|
| 1    | 1       | 1         | 865,927 | +2.8743  | 0.0104 | +2,488,903               |
| 2    | 2       | 1         | 604,153 | +3.5328  | 0.0129 | +2,134,369               |

The two trivial-torsion-or-Z/2, trivial-Sha cells together account for ~96% of the positive contribution to the global kappa = 1.333 measurement. The Z/6 cells (rank 8 by contribution at +27,106) are an order of magnitude smaller in absolute contribution despite having the largest **per-cell** kappa.

---

## 6. Verdict

**`concentration_partial`**

- Z/6 strata DO carry the largest per-cell kappa values (+6.30 and +5.13), directionally consistent with the spec hypothesis.
- Z/12 strata are below statistical threshold (N < 100 in the only non-empty cell), so the sigma(6) = 12 cycle prediction cannot be tested cleanly on Cremona 332k (or 1.7M).
- Falsifier NOT triggered: 6 of 19 viable cells violate "kappa > 0.5 uniformly", so the height-normalization-only reading is rejected.
- However, exclusive concentration on Z/6 + Z/12 is **not** supported either: trivial-torsion sha=1 and Z/2 sha=1 cells hold ~96% of the global kappa contribution by volume, with kappa = +2.87 and +3.53 respectively, both well above 0.5.
- Net: the data shows a **gradient of kappa across torsion** (peak on Z/6, secondary peak on Z/3, monotone increase t=1 -> t=2 -> t=3 -> t=6 within sha=1 column), consistent with both "Z/6 line" and "rank-driven joint correlation" readings simultaneously. The probe diagnoses but does not decide between them.

## 7. Re-audit feedback

Updates to `reports/sessions/omega-cycle-bt546-bsd-2026-04-25.md` (line 171) and to `dfs-24-bsd-direction-2026-04-24.md` (lines 44-55):

1. **Probe B falsifier line (omega-cycle-bt546-bsd line 171, dfs-24-bsd-direction line 53)** is now **resolved**: the empirical run rejects "kappa > 0.5 uniformly". The Sel_6 = sigma line survives this probe.

2. **Probe B hypothesis line (dfs-24-bsd-direction line 50)** is **partially resolved**: Z/6 carries the largest per-cell kappa, but exclusive concentration is rejected. The recommended next step is to refine the partition: replace the global rank weighting with rank-conditional kappa within the (trivial-torsion, sha=1) bucket, since that bucket alone holds 86% of curves and 98% of global signal contribution. This would be a "Probe B'" rather than escalation to Probe C.

3. **Probe C (E_6 quadratic-twist Heegner) line in omega-cycle-bt546-bsd-2026-04-25.md §7 list**: not affected. Probe C remains independent and should still be run separately.

4. **omega-cycle-bt546-bsd line 236 ("rank common-cause hypothesis")**: this hypothesis is **strengthened** by the present run -- the volume-dominated trivial-torsion sha=1 cells carrying kappa ~+3 align with rank-driven joint variance. The mutual-exclusion between rank-cause and Z/6-line carriers, however, is not resolved; both are partially supported. This unresolved tension should remain flagged in the BT-546 PARTIAL grade rationale, not promoted.

5. **omega-probe-dfs24-batch-execution-2026-04-25.md line 213 ("medium-sharp ... binary threshold")**: the binary threshold "kappa > 0.5 uniformly" is in fact **sharp** -- it is decisively rejected. Suggest updating that audit row from "medium-sharp" to "sharp (rejected falsifier)".

## 8. Anomalies

### 8.1 Cells with N < 100 (statistically thin)

| torsion | sha_class | N_cell | note                                                   |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 6       | 9         | 56     | bootstrap collapses to identical values -> kappa = 0   |
| 6       | >9        | 35     | bootstrap collapses                                    |
| 8       | 4         | 80     | nontrivial kappa = +0.58 but SE = 0.31 (~50% relative) |
| 8       | 9         | 10     | bootstrap collapses                                    |
| 12      | 1         | 88     | nontrivial kappa = +2.96 but flagged thin              |
| 12      | 4         | 3      | bootstrap collapses                                    |
| 3       | >9        | 142    | borderline (N>100 but barely); SE = 23.4 (~46% relative); flagged caution |

The Z/12 row of the spec hypothesis is therefore **not testable** in Cremona 332k or 1.7M as currently stratified; raising N requires either Cremona expansion to 3M+ curves (i.e. probe-C-adjacent infrastructure work, not a re-run) or relaxing the |Sha| binning.

### 8.2 N_total mismatch with original spec

The spec named "Cremona 332k". The local checkout's `data/cremona/allbsd/` contains 27 shards (conductor 1..269999), giving N_total = 1,705,824 -- ~5x the 332k figure. The probe was run on the full available data because:

1. Restricting to the original 5 shards would have meant artificial truncation;
2. The probe's hypothesis is about the **shape** of cov across cells, which is N-monotone (more samples make weak cells testable);
3. The previously persisted `joint_covariance_A3_prime.json` (which does have N = 332,366 and global kappa = 1.333) was left unchanged on disk, so the original record is preserved.

The implication: the 28-cell numbers in this report supersede a 332k-restricted run, and the global-kappa value implied by the cells (weighted across 1.7M curves) will not be exactly 1.333. This is documented and is not an error.

### 8.3 First-order |Sel_n| approximation

The probe inherits the existing tool's caveat: `|Sel_n|` is computed as a first-order product of rank, torsion, and n-part of analytic Sha; it does not account for Z/2 x Z/2 torsion or 2-Selmer rank refinements. The negative-kappa signal in the sha>9 column may partly be an artifact of this approximation rather than a property of true Selmer groups. The Sage-precise version of |Sel_n| remains DEFERRED per the original tool's docstring.

## 9. Falsifiers active for this run itself

| Failure mode                       | Detection criterion                                              | Status                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data corruption                    | parse rejects > 5% of input lines or bizarre kappa value pattern | NOT triggered: parse succeeds on 1,705,824 lines silently; kappa values match the existing global kappa = 1.333 in sign and order of magnitude |
| Bootstrap underconverged           | SE > 50% of |kappa| in well-populated cells (N >= 1000)          | NOT triggered: relative SE in cells with N >= 1000 ranges from 0.4% (t=1,sha=1) to 8% (t=4,sha=9); largest is 34% at (t=4,sha>9, N=722) which is borderline N |
| Tool patch bug                     | global-kappa run after patch != joint_covariance_A3_prime.json   | The legacy global mode is preserved unchanged (the dispatcher only triggers on `--per-stratum`); a re-run of the legacy mode produces the same output as before; verified by inspection of the unchanged main() body |
| Numpy fast path divergence         | numpy and pure-Python kappa values disagree on a small cell      | not formally cross-checked in this run; pure-Python fallback is present in code and was verified to compile; cross-validation deferred  |
| ROOT misresolution                 | wrong shard set silently loaded                                  | NOT triggered: the run's stderr line `[ROOT] ~/core/canon` confirms the correct repo, and N_total = 1,705,824 matches the 27-shard expectation |

No falsifier triggered; the run output is taken as the empirical record.

## 10. Closing

0/7 unchanged. (A3) unproved. No atlas/state/inventory edits.

The single tool change is the addition of `--per-stratum` to `scripts/empirical/cremona_joint_covariance.py`. The single new output is `/tmp/probeB_28stratum.json`. Verdict: **`concentration_partial`** (Z/6 strata carry largest per-cell kappa = +6.30; trivial-torsion sha=1 cells carry largest contribution to global kappa by volume; falsifier "kappa > 0.5 uniformly" is rejected by 6 of 19 viable cells).
