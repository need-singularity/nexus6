# Omega-Deploy: 3 Design Docs to Nexus (2026-04-25)

## 1. Authorization context

The absorption omega cycle audit
(`reports/sessions/omega-cycle-absorption-7bt-to-nexus-2026-04-25.md`)
returned verdict **ABSORB_DESIGN_ONLY**, with 3 deploy-ready specs identified.
User issued explicit "go" authorization to execute the cross-repo deploy of
exactly 3 new files into `~/core/nexus/design/`.

This deploy is parallel to the earlier honesty_triad.md deploy
(`reports/sessions/omega-deploy-nexus-honesty-triad-2026-04-25.md`, 1 doc + 7-line
append) — that work already ships the design-pattern reference, so no append is
required here.

## 2. Pre-deploy verification

Hard constraints honored:
- No writes to nexus atlas/state/inventory/lenses/CLAUDE.md.bak/project-claude/nexus.md.
- No writes to canon atlas/state/inventory.
- No git commits.
- Only 3 new files in `~/core/nexus/design/`.

The canon working tree had pre-existing modifications at session start
(per gitStatus: `state/proposals/inventory.json`,
`reports/sessions/specs/2026-04-02-kstar-n6-tokamak-design.md`,
`reports/sessions/specs/2026-04-02-ultimate-fusion-powerplant-design.md`).
None of these were touched by this deploy.

## 4. Files NOT modified (verification list)

Protected (nexus):
- `~/core/nexus/n6/atlas.blowup.jsonl` — untouched (mtime Apr 22 02:30).
- `~/core/nexus/state/proposals/inventory.json` — untouched by this session.
- `~/core/nexus/state/atlas_health_timeline.jsonl` — untouched by this session
  (mtime change at 22:30 is from another agent / out of scope).
- `~/core/nexus/state/agent_lock_ledger.jsonl` — untouched (mtime Apr 22 22:07).
- `~/core/nexus/lenses/omega_state_space_lens.hexa` — untouched (mtime Apr 22 02:30).
- `~/core/nexus/CLAUDE.md.bak` — untouched (mtime Apr 22 02:30).
- `~/core/nexus/project-claude/nexus.md` — untouched (mtime Apr 25 21:07,
  predates this deploy).
- `~/core/nexus/CLAUDE.md` — not modified (out of scope per spec).

Protected (canon):
- `state/proposals/inventory.json` — untouched by this deploy (pre-existing
  modifications carried forward unchanged).
- atlas paths — not written.

## 5. Cross-repo summary

This session, combined with the honesty_triad precedent, deploys 4 design docs
total to `~/core/nexus/design/`:
1. `honesty_triad.md` (precedent, 2026-04-25 21:06).
2. `method_gap_pattern.md` (this deploy).
3. `progressive_deepening_methodology.md` (this deploy).
4. `3pillar_obstruction_localization.md` (this deploy).

Net deltas:
- Millennium resolved: **0/7 unchanged** (design docs make no claim on conjectures).
- nxs promotion-count delta: **0** (design docs are not atlas entries).
- Atlas/state/inventory/lens deltas: **0**.

The deploy is **design-only**, matching the ABSORB_DESIGN_ONLY verdict
exactly — no factual claims, no atlas mutations, no promotion-counter movement.

## 6. Falsifiers active

Inherited from parent reports (still in force):
- F-3PILLAR-A/B/C (in `3pillar_obstruction_localization.md`):
  heterogeneity, artifactual convergence, post-hoc framing checks.
- PATTERN_STRONGLY_GENERAL caveat (BT-541 single-family) carried
  in `method_gap_pattern.md` lineage section.
- Anti-patterns enumerated in `progressive_deepening_methodology.md`:
  cosmetic retries, premature INCONCLUSIVE, L1 abandonment.

Deploy-specific:
- F-DEPLOY-A: source-report drift (if synthesis reports are later retracted,
  these docs must be re-audited).
- F-DEPLOY-B: cross-repo divergence (if nexus design/ evolves separately,
  canon session lineage must be re-tagged).

## 7. Closing

3 design docs deployed under ABSORB_DESIGN_ONLY verdict. No atlas / state /
inventory / promotion-count changes. No git commits. Honesty triad maintained:
no fabrication, write-barrier respected, promotion-counter unchanged.

Deploy complete.
