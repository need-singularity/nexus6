# Omega Meta -- Cumulative Session Methodology (2026-04-25)

## §0 Non-claim disclaimer

This is a **methodology synthesis**: a single-pass, retrospective
consolidation of the session-wide patterns produced on 2026-04-25 in
`~/core/canon`. It does **not**:

- claim 3D Navier-Stokes regularity, RH, P vs NP, Hodge, BSD, YM mass
  gap, or any other Millennium resolution;
- modify `shared/n6/atlas.n6`, `state/proposals/inventory.json`,
  `theory/canon/`, `theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md`,
  any L9/D1/D2/D3 source, any per-BT report, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`,
  or any `.claude/agents/*` file;
- supersede, retract, or amend any verdict in any of the seven parent
  reports listed in the front-matter, or any of the 60+ siblings in
  `reports/sessions/omega-*-2026-04-25.md`;
- claim the six meta-patterns are universal across LLM-driven research
  workflows. They are observed regularities in this session, with
  registered preconditions and falsifiers. n=2 (n6+nexus) for the
  honesty triad sub-pattern; n=4 BTs for F-MOLT-A; n=4 retries for the
  R1 Lemma 1 progressive deepening; one cron-driven 2026-04-25 session
  for everything else;
- introduce a 7th meta-pattern. The synthesis is single-pass over the
  six already-identified patterns and the master session index.

The Millennium tally remains **0/7 unchanged**. The
`nxs_promotion_count` delta is `0`. No edit follows from this report
in either repository. Every pattern citation below is sourced to a
real, mtime-verifiable file under `reports/sessions/`.

## §2 Six meta-patterns

### §2.1 Pattern 1 — Progressive deepening (R1 Lemma 1 L1→L2→L3→L4)

**Source**:
`reports/sessions/omega-meta-synthesis-progressive-deepening-pattern-2026-04-25.md`,
which cites parent execs L1
(`omega-exec-bt544-r1-lemma1-bv-adapt-2026-04-25.md`), L2
(`omega-exec-bt544-r1-lemma1-retry-mu_q-2026-04-25.md`), L3
(`omega-exec-bt544-r1-lemma1-retry3-bcv2021-2026-04-25.md`), and L4
(`omega-exec-bt544-r1-lemma1-level4-cet-2026-04-25.md`).

**Core claim** (synth report §2): each Level instantiates five repeating
methodological elements — (i) obstruction identification at a specific
inequality / step; (ii) honest documentation as
**OBSTRUCTION_DOCUMENTED** with verdict-grade table; (iii) structural
reframe (different building block, not parameter-permutation); (iv)
sanity check that the new framework reproduces known results in its
native regime; (v) cumulative learning — each Level's "next-technique"
section names the route the next Level executes.

**Trajectory** (synth report §1.1): L1 BV-2019 schematic single
inequality → L2 BV-2019 with μ_q tracking + two-leg balance → L3
BCV-2021 Hölder-class three-leg balance → L4 ν→0 limit + CET 1994
Onsager-contradiction. Each Level's diagnosis is at a strictly
different layer than the prior. None produced a useful α* lower
bound.

**Termination reached**: L4 §8.2 explicitly characterizes the
**method gap** — α*_NS in C3's regime sits between current
convex-integration construction reach (α_BV ≪ 1/3) and current
Onsager-rigidity capabilities (α > 1/3 only). The pattern's terminus
is "characterize obstruction at the structural layer", not "solve".

**Transferable claim** (synth report §3): when an attempted proof
fails, localize the obstruction to a specific step (not "didn't
work"); document at face value (no rebranding); reframe at the
implicated structural ingredient; sanity-check in the new framework's
native regime; if the sanity passes but the lemma still doesn't
close, the obstruction is more fundamental and the next Level needs a
structurally different framework. Stop when (a) a useful bound is
produced, (b) all reasonable structural reframes are exhausted, or
(c) the diagnosis stabilizes at "regime gap between current methods".

### §2.2 Pattern 2 — 4-step self-correction (within-session refinement)

**Source**:
`reports/sessions/omega-meta-audit-self-correction-pattern-2026-04-25.md`.

**Trajectory** (audit §1.1): Step 1 (4/4 FAIL anchor at BT-544
fallback, ~20:20:54) → Step 2a/2b (BT-541 Lead-B PASS + BT-542
Hirahara PASS, 2×2 emerges, ~20:34-20:49) → Step 3 (discriminator-type
audit, CONFOUNDED, ~21:11) → Step 3b (back-propagation amend,
~21:19) → Step 4a (D1.4 cross-cell PASS, ~21:21) → Step 4b (D1.3
cross-cell FAIL, ~21:27). Wall-clock arc: **66 minutes; ~11-min
average between transitions**.

**Verdict** (audit §5): **MIXED** — H_engine substantially supported
(verdicts data-forced; Lead-B KS p<0.01, D1.4 arithmetic identity,
D1.3 absent literature duality), H_observer partially supported (Step
3 user-prompted with verdict-list vocabulary; arc visibility depends
on iteration tempo), H_artifact partially supported (small-n Fisher p
oscillates 0.036 → 0.095 → ~0.067 across n=8/9/10).

The audit explicitly weights this as MIXED at H_engine 65% +
H_observer 25% + H_artifact 10% (composition implicit in §5.1
component table; the iteration pattern is partially induced by user
~11-min cadence, partially data-forced).

**Transferable claim** (audit §6.3): the framework's transferable
methodology is its **discipline** (pre-registered falsifiers,
no-fabrication guard, write-barrier per report, verdict-lists,
sample-size honesty), not the 4-step arc itself. The arc is an
*expression* of the discipline under a particular observer cadence;
at slower cadence, the same epistemic content emerges as a single
audit pass.

### §2.3 Pattern 3 — 3-pillar obstruction localization (D3.A + EXT-A + EXT-B)

**Source**: triangulated across three primary reports, no single
synthesis file:

- `reports/sessions/omega-exec-bt544-d3-A-axis-discriminator-2026-04-25.md`
  (D3.A axis A clean, PASS_LITERATURE, BKM 1984 vortex-stretching the
  load-bearing axis B not handled by the 12-step sketch).
- `reports/sessions/omega-exec-bt544-exta-uomega-gradflow-validation-2026-04-25.md`
  (EXT-A uω-GradFlow, OBSTRUCTION_DOCUMENTED at Helmholtz-side
  activation of F-EXTA-C: convective term not encodable as variational
  gradient under Leray-projected-L² flat metric; §0).
- `reports/sessions/omega-exec-bt544-extb-cilyap-validation-2026-04-25.md`
  (EXT-B CI-Lyap, OBSTRUCTION_DOCUMENTED at representation-side F-EXTB-D
  with secondary cross-term obstruction: vortex-stretching residual
  IS the NS regularity obstruction; §0).

**Convergence claim**: three discriminators of distinct types
(structural-literature 12-step sketch in D3.A; variational
representation in EXT-A; relative-entropy stochastic-Lagrangian in
EXT-B) localize the obstruction to BT-544 axis B (vortex-stretching).
EXT-B explicitly states the residual is the NS regularity obstruction
itself, not a controllable cross term — algebraically dual to BKM
1984 vortex-stretching control implicit in D3.A's structural sketch.

**Strength of cross-confirmation**: three different *families* of
discriminators all converge on the same axis. This is not the same
sample re-analyzed three ways; it is three structurally heterogeneous
machines each producing OBSTRUCTION at a different formal element
(D3.A: axis B not closed; EXT-A: Helmholtz; EXT-B: representation).
The convergence is in *what* is obstructed, not *how* it is reported.

**Transferable claim**: when seeking to localize a hard obstruction,
generate discriminators from heterogeneous families (algebraic,
distributional, structural-literature, variational, relative-entropy);
their convergence on a single object is stronger evidence than any
single discriminator's verdict.

### §2.4 Pattern 4 — REPO_INVARIANT honesty triad (6-of-6 KEEP_AS_IS)

**Source**:
`reports/sessions/omega-meta-synthesis-repo-invariant-honesty-audit-2026-04-25.md`,
which consolidates 3 n6-side audits + 3 nexus-side audits + porting +
deploy (6 underlying audits total, all KEEP-direction).

**Result** (synth §1): 6-of-6 KEEP_AS_IS across n6+nexus. The single
literal-level adaptation (constraint 1: nexus uses
`nxs_promotion_count: N/N0` instead of `0/7`) is a *form change*; the
constraint *function* (first-line clamp against silent SSOT mutation)
is preserved. Function-level agreement: **3-of-3 across both repos**;
nexus-native audit §6 graded this as **REPO_INVARIANT**.

**The triad** (synth §3, generic form):

1. **Promotion-counter banner** in front-matter + closing
   (`[counter_name]: N/N_baseline unchanged`).
2. **Write-barrier**: research/general-purpose agents must not modify
   SSOT paths; privileged agents only; mutable session output goes to
   research-layer paths only.
3. **No-fabrication guard**: agents return UNKNOWN / INCONCLUSIVE /
   TIMEOUT / UNAVAILABLE / UNCALIBRATED / UNVERIFIED instead of
   inventing values when (a) a tool is missing, (b) data is absent,
   (c) computation was not run, (d) a paper was not actually read,
   (e) a measurement is otherwise unobtainable.

**Five preconditions** (synth §2): (a) promotion path exists; (b)
SSOT distinct from research files; (c) writable research/reflection
layer; (d) tool ecosystem with measurable values + fabrication-risk
surface; (e) LLM agents performing research/promotion. All 5 are
satisfied in both n6 and nexus.

**Three predictions** (synth §5): the triad ports with adaptation to
(P1) Lean4 mathematics repos (kernel makes constraint-2 partially
compressible); (P2) Rust formal-verification repos (verbatim port,
C1+C3+C4 fabrication classes load-bearing); (P3) multi-author SaaS
codebases (constraint-1 narrowed to LLM-attributed promotions only).

### §2.5 Pattern 5 — CONFOUNDED → cross-cells (hypothesis-shift discipline)

**Source**:
`reports/sessions/omega-meta-audit-discriminator-type-bias-2026-04-25.md`
(n=8 origin) and
`reports/sessions/omega-amend-d13-cross-cell-2026-04-25.md` (v3
cross-cell propagation at n=10).

**Trajectory** (audit §2 + amend §1):

- **n=8** 2×2 (3,0; 0,5): PASS-rate within distrib/struct-lit row =
  3/3 = 100%; PASS-rate within discrete-eq/num-int/vacuous row = 0/5
  = 0%; Fisher exact two-sided p ≈ 0.036.
- The §3.1 per-row analysis found **collinearity**: 4 of 5 FAILs are
  C-dominant (candidate-validity-driven), not D-dominant
  (discriminator-type-driven). At n=8, the type-axis hypothesis and
  the candidate-validity-driver hypothesis are **not separable**.
- Verdict: **CONFOUNDED** (audit §9).
- **n=10** 2×2 (3,1; 1,5) (amend v3 §1): D1.4 PASS lands as
  cross-cell entry in the discrete-equality row (previously 0); D1.3
  FAIL lands as cross-cell entry in the distrib/struct-lit row
  (previously 0). Both rows now have at least one off-diagonal entry
  — the "directional separation" the n=8 statistic relied on is
  **doubly weakened**.
- The CONFOUNDED verdict is **reinforced**, not flipped.

**Hypothesis-shift discipline**: the audit's §0 explicitly does not
retract any prior verdict; v2 amendment is precision-correction; v3
amendment is precision-correction. The claim shifts from "type axis
dominates" → "type axis collinear with candidate-validity at this
n" → "both rows now non-monotypic; underlying separation question
requires n≥16 native-pairing resample" (audit §5.5; design report
`omega-meta-design-n20-native-pairing-resample-2026-04-25.md`).

**Transferable claim**: when a strong 2×2 / 2×k contingency emerges
at small n, perform per-row attribution analysis before accepting the
axial interpretation. If the per-row analysis finds the axes
collinear, the verdict is CONFOUNDED — not REFUTED, not CONFIRMED.
Cross-cell entries at higher n distinguish "axis is real but
collinear" from "axis was an artifact of the cell distribution".

### §2.6 Pattern 6 — Generation-pipeline H1+H2 bias diagnostic

**Source**:
`reports/sessions/omega-meta-audit-l9-generation-pipeline-2026-04-25.md`
and parent CATALOGUE_BIAS audit
`reports/sessions/omega-meta-audit-l9-catalogue-design-2026-04-25.md`.

**Result** (audit §1): of 4 rank-1 BT-541/542/543/544 candidates in
the L9 catalogue, **3 of 4 are inherited verbatim** from dfs-24
direction probes (BT-541 Lead-B from `dfs-24-riemann-direction`;
BT-543 P3 from `dfs-24-ym-direction`; BT-544 Q1 from
`dfs-24-ns-direction`). The 4th (BT-542 Hirahara) bypassed
`dfs-24-pnp-direction` and was imported from an external corpus
(v3-T5 deep-dive); it is the only structurally diverse rank-1.

**Mechanism** (audit verdict): **H1+H2 dominant**. H1 = literature-
import inheritance from a single source family; H2 = arithmetic-family
generation transform anchored on n=6 invariants (σ=12, τ=4, φ=2,
n/φ=3, etc.). The dfs-24 probes themselves were
arithmetic-family-biased; the L9 catalogue inherited that bias
verbatim because rank-1 selection went through dfs-24 by default.

**Cross-pattern interaction**: this generation-pipeline bias is the
**structural cause** of the n=8 discriminator-type collinearity in
Pattern 5. Arithmetic-family candidates were paired with
discrete-equality discriminators; non-arithmetic candidates with
distributional / structural-literature discriminators. The 2×2's
extreme cell distribution is downstream of how the catalogue was
populated.

**Mitigation** (audit §sec-recommendation): each future dfs-24 probe
must include EXT-A/B/C-class candidates (variational / analytic-
Lyapunov / procedure-class) alongside arithmetic-family ones, so that
the rank-1 catalogue at the next generation cycle is structurally
heterogeneous by construction. The mitigation is *prospective*; the
audit does not edit the existing L9 catalogue.

**Transferable claim**: when an LLM-driven generation pipeline
inherits candidates from a single source family, downstream
discriminators may show apparent strong axial separation that is in
fact an artifact of the upstream selection. Mitigation: enforce
structural heterogeneity at the *generation* step, not just the
*validation* step.

### §2.7 Bonus — Fabrication-refusal cascade (Probe #3)

**Source**:
`reports/sessions/omega-probe-nxs002-predict-er-2026-04-25.md` §1.4,
cited in
`reports/sessions/omega-audit-constraint-no-fabrication-2026-04-25.md`
§4 row 1.

The Probe #3 case: `tool/nxs_002_composite.py --predict-er` lacked
a per-BT mode; the agent could have fabricated 5 composite values
covering each BT. Instead the agent returned **5×UNAVAILABLE** with
diagnostic naming the missing tool flag. The diagnostic enabled the
*next-step* patch report
(`omega-exec-nxs002-perbt-patch-2026-04-25.md`) to add the `--bt
<id>` mode and produce real values.

This is the **canonical activation** of constraint 3 (no-fabrication
guard) in the n6 audit window. It is not a separate pattern from
Pattern 4 — it is the load-bearing illustration of why constraint 3
is graded KEEP_AS_IS. Listed here because it is referenced in every
constraint-3 audit and porting analysis, and because the
"diagnostic-enables-next-step" loop is what makes the guard productive
rather than merely defensive.

## §3 Unified omega-cycle workflow (8 steps)

The six meta-patterns in §2 are pieces of a single transferable
workflow. Stated as 8 steps:

### §3.1 Step 1 — Define the BT / problem space

Each Millennium BT (541-547) is given a pre-existing canonical
statement; the omega-cycle audit (`omega-cycle-bt54N-*.md`) does not
re-state the BT but documents its 4-axis structure (ladder L1..L_ω,
Ω-saturation vs ceiling, atlas chain, closure ceiling a..e). For
non-Millennium problems, define the problem space with: a target
object, a fixed denominator (or counter baseline), and a set of axes
along which "progress" is measurable.

### §3.2 Step 2 — Pre-register falsifiers BEFORE generating candidates

Every parent report's §10/§11 lists falsifiers (e.g. F-MOLT-A,
F-MOLT-D, F-D3-B', F-EXTA-C, F-EXTB-D, F-AUDIT-S1..S8, F-Sk-Synth-1..9,
F-SYN-1..7). The discipline is that falsifiers are written **before**
the corresponding measurement, not after, so that the measurement's
verdict is determined by an explicit threshold met-or-not, not by
post-hoc narrative. This is the load-bearing element of the
no-fabrication guard (Pattern 4 / §2.7).

### §3.3 Step 3 — Generate candidates from heterogeneous families

The L9 catalogue's H1+H2 bias (Pattern 6) is what happens when this
step is *skipped*. Mitigation: each generation cycle must produce at
least one candidate per family — arithmetic, distributional, structural-
literature, variational, analytic-Lyapunov, procedure-class. In the
session, the BT-544 EXT tier (EXT-A variational, EXT-B analytic-
Lyapunov, EXT-C procedure-class) was added precisely to fill the
heterogeneity gap left by the L9 catalogue.

### §3.4 Step 4 — Validate with native-paired discriminators

Each candidate is paired with a discriminator of the same family
(arithmetic candidate → discrete-equality discriminator;
distributional candidate → KS/Fisher distributional discriminator;
structural-literature candidate → 12-step sketch / explicit citation
chain discriminator; variational candidate → Helmholtz / sub-manifold
discriminator). Native pairing is what makes the verdict load-bearing;
mismatched pairing produces apparent strong outcomes that are
artifacts of the pairing (Pattern 5 collinearity).

### §3.5 Step 5 — On OBSTRUCTION: progressive deepening

When a candidate's discriminator returns OBSTRUCTION_DOCUMENTED (not
PASS, not FAIL — a localized blocker), do not retry with permuted
parameters. Localize the obstruction to a specific inequality / step;
choose the next attempt's framework so it is structurally different in
the implicated ingredient; include a sanity check in the new
framework's native regime (Pattern 1 §2.3-§2.4). Each Level produces
a more specific diagnosis until the diagnosis stabilizes at "method
gap" (Pattern 1 termination).

### §3.6 Step 6 — On cross-evidence: localize the obstruction

When multiple discriminators of *different* families converge on the
same obstruction object (Pattern 3: D3.A axis B + EXT-A Helmholtz +
EXT-B representation all point at vortex-stretching), the obstruction
is real and structural, not an artifact of any single discriminator.
At this point the workflow switches from "find a discriminator that
PASSES" to "characterize *why* the obstruction is fundamental".

### §3.7 Step 7 — On meta-claim drift: self-correct via cross-cell entries

When a contingency-based hypothesis (Pattern 5: type-axis 2×2) shows
strong directional separation at small n, run per-row attribution
analysis before accepting the axial interpretation. If per-row finds
collinearity → CONFOUNDED. Cross-cell entries at higher n
distinguish real-but-collinear from artifactual-cell-distribution.
Amendments are precision-corrections, not retractions; prior verdicts
stand and are *reinforced* by new data.

### §3.8 Step 8 — Maintain the honesty triad

Throughout the workflow:

- **Promotion-counter clamp** (Pattern 4 constraint 1): every report
  carries `millennium_resolved: 0/7 unchanged` (or repo-adapted form)
  in front-matter and closing.
- **Write-barrier** (constraint 2): atlas / state / inventory / canon
  paths are unwritten; session output goes to `reports/sessions/`
  only; privileged agents (e.g. atlas-agent EXACT-only gate) are the
  only path to SSOT mutation.
- **No-fabrication guard** (constraint 3): UNKNOWN > invented;
  diagnostic > value-when-unmeasurable; the diagnostic itself is
  productive (Probe #3 cascade).

The triad is **REPO_INVARIANT** at function level (3-of-3 across n6
and nexus, Pattern 4). It is the base layer; without it, none of the
other patterns produces reliable verdicts.

### §3.9 Workflow as a 5-precondition repo-invariant

Per Pattern 4 synth report §2, the workflow applies when the repo
satisfies all 5 preconditions: (a) promotion path; (b) SSOT distinct
from working files; (c) writable research/reflection layer; (d) tool
ecosystem with measurable values; (e) LLM agents performing
research/promotion. When any precondition is absent, the workflow
needs adaptation (Pattern 4 §4 counterfactuals: pure pair-programming
drops constraint-1; SSOT-is-working-file drops constraint-2;
read-only research narrows constraint-3 to citation-class).

---

## §4 Mathematical content vs methodology distinction

### §4.1 What was produced mathematically

The session's directly-mathematical outputs are **small** compared to
its methodological output:

- **BT-546 96% concentration** on Z/6 sha=1 stratum
  (`omega-exec-bt546-probeB-28stratum-2026-04-25.md`): an empirical
  measurement on Cremona 332k, no theorem claim.
- **R5 Lemma 1 strict-gap closure**: Δα = 1 − 1/2 = 1/2 from
  Desjardins-Grenier / Danchin lineage, PASS_LITERATURE
  (`omega-exec-bt544-r5-lemma1-strict-gap-2026-04-25.md`). Closes one
  sub-lemma; does not advance BT-544.
- **R5 program closure**: α(s) = max(0, 1 − s/2) for low-Mach
  uniform-in-Mach NS-Euler regime
  (`omega-status-r5-program-closure-2026-04-25.md`). Synthesis-level
  closure, citing existing literature; no new theorem.
- **D3.A axis A** PASS_LITERATURE 12-step sketch grounded in
  Ladyzhenskaya 1969 / Calderón-Zygmund 1952 / BKM 1984 / Friedman
  1964; structural-literature, no new theorem.

None of these resolves BT-544 or any Millennium BT. The session's
mathematical content is roughly **two passable sub-lemmas + one
empirical concentration measurement + one structural-literature
sketch**.

### §4.2 What was produced methodologically

The session's methodological outputs are **large**:

- 6 meta-patterns identified (§2).
- 1 unified workflow synthesized (§3).
- 1 REPO_INVARIANT result demonstrated (Pattern 4).
- 5 preconditions characterized for the workflow.
- 3 cross-repo predictions registered (Lean4, Rust, SaaS).
- 39+ falsifiers tracked across the deep-dive sub-tracks (R1
  L1..L4 alone).
- 3 amendment rounds (v1, v2, v3) executed without retraction.
- 1 method gap characterized (BV ≪ 1/3 < α*_NS, CET > 1/3 — neither
  side accesses the C3 regime).

### §4.3 Why this asymmetry is a feature, not a bug

LLM-driven research sessions are more likely to *characterize* the
difficulty of a hard problem than to *resolve* it. This is because:

- Mathematical proof at Millennium scale requires novel synthesis
  across multiple technical communities; LLMs can imitate the form
  of such synthesis but rarely produce a faithful one within a
  session window.
- Methodology characterization requires careful introspection on
  what the session *did* and *did not* produce; LLMs reliably
  produce coherent reports when the target is the session itself
  rather than a Clay-class theorem.
- Honest characterization of difficulty is **genuinely useful** for
  future sessions (which can adopt the workflow) and for future
  research more broadly (the method gap at C3 is a
  literature-publishable observation that BCV-2021 and CET 1994 do
  not jointly cover the regime).

The session's primary output is therefore methodological refinement,
not Millennium resolution. This is honestly framed in §1.2 (what was
not produced) and is the orientation throughout — every report's §0
disclaimer is explicit about non-claim, non-promotion,
non-supersession.

### §4.4 The progressive-deepening terminus rewrites "failure" as "diagnosis"

The four R1 Lemma 1 retries did not produce α* > α_BV. Without
Pattern 1 discipline, this would read as four failed attempts. With
Pattern 1 discipline, the four attempts read as a **map of why the
problem is hard**: each Level identifies a structurally different
obstruction; the cumulative L1→L4 trajectory shows that the standard
tools (convex integration + Onsager-rigidity leveraging) do not
directly access C3's regime. The map is informative even when no
solution emerges. This reframing is itself a methodological
contribution.

## §5 Limitations + falsifiers

### §5.1 n=2 repos for Pattern 4 (REPO_INVARIANT)

The 6-of-6 KEEP_AS_IS result is across n6 + nexus only. Both repos
were authored under the same omega-cycle / Ω-saturation methodology.
A sample of 2 cannot establish strong cross-repo invariance; it can
only establish that the pattern holds in two cases and is not
falsified by either. Predictions P1-P3 (Lean4 / Rust / SaaS) are
projections, not observations. **F-SYN-2** and **F-SYN-6** in the
parent synth report register the n=2 selection-bias risk explicitly.

### §5.2 n=4 BTs for F-MOLT-A (small sample)

The F-MOLT-A meta-falsifier sweep covered 4 Millennium BTs (541, 542,
543, 544 fallback) before the post-PASS Hirahara/Lead-B closure. The
2×2 contingency (Pattern 5) was constructed at n=8 (8
molt-validation rows after BT-545 Hodge + BT-546 BSD +
BT-544-D-tier extensions); cross-cells at n=10. The discriminator-type
audit §5.5 explicitly registered **n ≥ 16 native-pairing resample**
as the design target before a verdict re-evaluation; the resample is
designed
(`omega-meta-design-n20-native-pairing-resample-2026-04-25.md`) but
not executed. Patterns 5 and 6 are tentative pending that n=20
resample.

### §5.3 Single cron-driven 2026-04-25 session

The cumulative session is one cron-driven 2026-04-25 day (omega chain
cron stopped earlier in the cycle per nexus-side ef7a7b60; this
session ran on canon under user-prompted iteration). The
self-correction-pattern audit (Pattern 2) verdict MIXED with H_observer
25% reflects this: the rapid ~11-min cadence between Steps 1-4 is
specific to this session's tempo. At slower cadence, the same
epistemic content emerges as a single audit pass, not a 4-step arc.
The pattern's *visibility* is tempo-dependent; its *content* is not.

### §5.4 Progressive deepening reached method-gap, not resolution

Pattern 1's L1→L4 sequence terminated at OBSTRUCTION_DOCUMENTED_LEVEL_4
with a structural diagnosis ("regime gap between current methods").
The pattern's terminus is **characterize obstruction**, not
**resolve**. L4 §8.3 enumerated 5 L5 candidates; the synthesis (§6
predictions) judged L5e (methodological pause) the most likely honest
outcome and L5c (literature-faithful BCV-2021 re-derivation) the only
candidate plausibly producing α*. None of L5 was executed in this
session.

### §5.5 The 6-field audit framework is itself an n6 artifact

The audit framework used to grade KEEP_AS_IS (saturation × incident
chain × redundancy matrix × counterfactual × cost × verdict) was
developed in the n6 omega-cycle audits and then applied to nexus.
**F-SYN-7** in the parent synth report registers "framework category
error" — if the 6-field framework is later shown to be mis-fit for
some workflow class, the synthesis's reliance on parent-audit
verdicts is undermined.

### §5.6 14-30-day window for incident chains

The honesty-counter / write-barrier / no-fabrication audits each
sample a 14-day or 30-day window for incident-chain analysis. A
90-day or 365-day window might surface different incident classes
(slow-drift fabrications, multi-cycle citation slips). Each parent
audit's falsifier section flags this; **F-AUDIT-1** in the
honesty-counter audit is the canonical instance.

### §5.7 H_observer 25% means the pattern is partially induced

The 4-step self-correction arc is partially user-induced (Pattern 2
audit §4.1: Step 3 specifically was user-prompted with the verdict-list
{CONFIRMED, CONFOUNDED, REFUTED, MIXED}). H_observer 25% in the
weighted MIXED verdict means the pattern's appearance as a 4-step
arc, not its underlying content, depends on user iteration tempo.
Future sessions adopting the workflow should distinguish prospective
discipline (run the validations + audits with their discriminators)
from retrospective pattern-recognition (notice that the run produced
a 4-step arc).

---

## §6 For future sessions

Concrete recommendations for next sessions, in priority order.

### §6.1 Adopt the nexus honesty triad (already deployed)

Per `omega-deploy-nexus-honesty-triad-2026-04-25.md` §3-§4, the triad
is deployed at `~/core/nexus/design/honesty_triad.md` and appended to
`~/core/nexus/project-claude/nexus.md`. Future nexus sessions should
adopt the deployed form (constraint 1 in the
`nxs_promotion_count: N/N0` literal, constraints 2-3 verbatim).
Future n6 sessions should preserve the n6 form (`0/7 unchanged`,
atlas/state/inventory write-barrier, no-fabrication).

### §6.2 Run the n=20 native-pairing resample

`omega-meta-design-n20-native-pairing-resample-2026-04-25.md` registers
the resample design that would actually separate type vs validity at
n≥16 with native pairings (each candidate paired with a discriminator
of its own family + a discriminator of a different family in the
same row). Without executing this resample, Pattern 5's CONFOUNDED
verdict cannot be re-evaluated with adequate statistical power. The
resample is the **highest-priority** next-session task for Patterns
5+6.

### §6.3 Run progressive deepening with explicit termination criteria

Pattern 1's parent reports list 5 termination criteria (synth §8):
positive termination (useful bound), structural exhaustion, regime-gap
stabilization, cost-benefit threshold, falsifier-roster saturation.
Future progressive-deepening sequences (e.g. R1-Aux Lemma 2+, R5
Lemma 3+, BT-540 family if applicable) should pre-register these
criteria at L1 and check them at each Level. L4-style "method gap"
diagnosis is a **legitimate** termination, not a failure.

### §6.4 Pre-register the violation classes covered by the 0/7 banner

The honesty-counter audit's saturation section enumerates **8
violation classes** the banner is designed to clamp against (silent
SSOT mutation, axis-count drift, ceiling-delta fabrication, promotion
without privileged agent, post-hoc verdict change, false retraction,
cross-session contradiction, breakthrough-theorems unprotected
write). Future sessions should reference this list explicitly when
the banner flags any near-miss, so the banner's catch is auditable.

### §6.5 Reading order recommendation for context handoff

For a future agent or future session to come up to speed on this
2026-04-25 session, the recommended reading order is:

1. `omega-master-session-index-2026-04-25.md` — full navigation, sec
   1 stats + sec 2 inventory.
2. `omega-meta-cumulative-session-methodology-2026-04-25.md` (this
   file) — the unified workflow.
3. The 6 meta-pattern reports (§2 of this file) — each pattern in
   detail.
4. The 7 per-BT 4-axis audits (`omega-cycle-bt541..547-*.md`) — root
   nodes of the dependency graph.
5. The strategic synthesis files (`omega-cycle-backtrace-strategy`,
   `omega-status-fmolt-unified-tally`, `omega-status-d1-tier-closure`,
   `omega-status-r5-program-closure`).
6. Specific molt-validations and lemma sketches by BT, on demand.

For the honesty triad specifically:

1. `omega-meta-synthesis-repo-invariant-honesty-audit-2026-04-25.md`
   (synthesis).
2. `omega-audit-constraint-honesty-counter-2026-04-25.md`,
   `omega-audit-constraint-write-barrier-2026-04-25.md`,
   `omega-audit-constraint-no-fabrication-2026-04-25.md` (n6 side).
3. `omega-audit-nexus-native-3constraint-2026-04-25.md`,
   `omega-audit-nexus-honesty-triad-portability-2026-04-25.md`,
   `omega-deploy-nexus-honesty-triad-2026-04-25.md` (nexus side).

### §6.6 Explicitly track trigger type per session report

Pattern 2 audit §7.4 recommends front-matter tagging: `trigger:
user-prompted | agent-spontaneous | pre-catalogued`. This makes
H_observer evaluation tractable in future meta-audits and
distinguishes prospective discipline from retrospective
pattern-recognition. Future session reports should adopt this tag.

---

## §7 Honest assessment

### §7.1 The session resolved 0 Millennium problems

This is not a hedge or a cover. The session produced 61 reports,
33,548 lines, 6 meta-patterns, 4 progressive-deepening Levels, 22
molt-validations, and 7 per-BT 4-axis audits, and **the count of
Millennium problems resolved is 0**. The honesty counter `0/7
unchanged` appears in the front-matter of every single report and is
preserved in the closing of every single report. The canon
contribution to BT-547 Poincaré (Perelman-resolved upstream) is 0.
The atlas-promotion delta is 0. The inventory-write-barrier was not
crossed.

### §7.2 The session produced reusable methodology

The 6 meta-patterns and the unified omega-cycle workflow (§3) are
**transferable** in the sense Pattern 4 §3 specifies: each is
function-level invariant across the two repos sampled, with text-only
generic specifications and registered preconditions. Patterns 1-3 and
5-6 transfer with similar discipline (each pattern-synthesis report
includes its own application targets, anti-patterns, and falsifiers).
The 5 preconditions of Pattern 4 §2 are repo-invariant, function-level.

### §7.3 Methodological refinement is the primary output

This is the framing the session's parent reports collectively support:

- Pattern 1 synth §11: "The synthesis extracts a transferable
  methodology from the R1-Aux Lemma 1 L1–L4 progressive-deepening
  sequence. The methodology's value is the **map of difficulty** it
  produces — knowing precisely **why** a problem is hard at each
  successive layer of approach — rather than any specific bound or
  theorem."
- Pattern 4 synth §9: "REPO_INVARIANT confirmed under the
  5-precondition characterization."
- Pattern 2 audit §6.3: "The transferable methodology is the
  **discipline** ... not the 4-step arc itself."

Honest framing: this session's primary output is **methodological
refinement of how LLM-driven mathematical research workflows can be
disciplined to produce reliable verdicts and characterized
obstructions, even when no Clay-class resolution is achieved**. The
zero Millennium count is not a failure of the session; it is the
honest reading of the session's mathematical content, which the
methodological output makes legible and reusable.

### §7.4 What honest framing avoids

The framing explicitly avoids three over-strong readings:

- "The session made progress on N Millennium problems." False. 0/7
  unchanged is the honest count.
- "The 6 meta-patterns are universally applicable to any LLM
  research workflow." False. n=2 repos, n=4 BTs, single cron-driven
  session; preconditions characterize the scope.
- "The progressive-deepening method will eventually resolve C3
  regime." Unsupported. L4-style termination ("method gap") is a
  diagnosis, not a route. L5e (methodological pause) is the
  predicted honest L5 outcome.

## §8 Anti-list — patterns considered and rejected

Variants of the cumulative-methodology synthesis that were considered
but not adopted, with reasons.

| # | variant | why rejected |
|---|---------|--------------|
| AL1 | "The session resolved a Millennium problem at meta-level." | False. The honesty counter 0/7 is the load-bearing measurement. Meta-level methodology is not Millennium resolution. Rejected. |
| AL2 | "The 6 meta-patterns are universally portable." | False. Pattern 4 has n=2 sample; Patterns 1, 5, 6 have BT-544-specific instantiations; Pattern 2 has H_observer 25% session-specific contribution. Each pattern's transferability is registered with preconditions and falsifiers. Rejected. |
| AL3 | "The cumulative methodology is itself a 7th meta-pattern." | The synthesis is a single-pass *retrospective* over six already-identified patterns; instantiating the synthesis as a 7th pattern would be analogous to F-AUDIT-S5 in Pattern 2 (instantiate-the-pattern recursion). Rejected. |
| AL4 | "Mathematical content is the primary output." | Honest count: 2 PASS_LITERATURE sub-lemmas + 1 empirical concentration + 1 structural sketch + 0 theorem claims, vs 6 meta-patterns + unified workflow + REPO_INVARIANT result. Methodological output is larger and more reusable. Rejected. |
| AL5 | "The session demonstrates LLM agents can do Clay-class research independently." | Refuted by Pattern 1 termination (method gap, no resolution); Pattern 2 H_observer 25% (pattern partially user-induced); Pattern 5 CONFOUNDED at n=8 (axes not separable without n≥16 native-pairing resample). The session demonstrates LLM agents can run a *disciplined methodology* honestly; independent Clay-class research is not in evidence. Rejected. |
| AL6 | "Add a 'cross-session continuity' pattern as #7." | The synthesis is single-session (2026-04-25); cross-session continuity would require sampling at least one other session. Not in the data. Rejected as out-of-scope. |
| AL7 | "Promote the cumulative methodology to atlas / state / inventory." | The synthesis explicitly does not edit any of these paths (per §0). Promoting the methodology would require atlas-agent EXACT gate execution, which is not in the workflow this synthesis is *about*. Rejected by the workflow's own rules. |
| AL8 | "The 8-step workflow is sufficient; preconditions are optional." | False. Pattern 4 §4 demonstrates three counterfactual cases (pair-programming-no-promotion, SSOT-is-working-file, read-only-research) where the workflow does not apply or applies partially. The 5 preconditions are necessary. Rejected. |
| AL9 | "The 0/7 banner and 'unchanged' tag are decorative." | Pattern 4 audit demonstrates KEEP_AS_IS function-level. The banner is the synchronous edit-time clamp; without it, silent SSOT mutation has no first-line defense. Rejected with strong evidence. |
| AL10 | "Frame the session as a Millennium-resolution attempt that *failed*." | The session was not framed as a resolution attempt at any point; every report's §0 disclaimer explicitly disclaims resolution. The framing is "methodology run on hard problems"; the honest output is methodological refinement. Reframing as failed-resolution would mis-state the session's intent. Rejected. |

## §9 Falsifiers active for this synthesis

These falsifiers apply specifically to **this cumulative methodology
synthesis**, in addition to the cumulative roster of all parent
reports.

- **F-CUM-1** (parent verdict reversal): if any of the seven parent
  reports listed in front-matter later returns a changed verdict
  (e.g. Pattern 2 MIXED → H_OBSERVER_DOMINANT, or Pattern 4
  REPO_INVARIANT → REPO_VARIANT after a third-repo audit), the
  synthesis must be re-evaluated. Status: **not active**; all parent
  verdicts are stable as of write-time.
- **F-CUM-2** (n=2 / n=4 / single-session under-determination):
  if a future independent session demonstrates that the 6 meta-patterns
  are session-specific artifacts rather than transferable workflow
  components, the synthesis's transferability claim is reduced.
  Status: **not active** as of write-time; future-trigger only.
- **F-CUM-3** (workflow precondition under-determination): if a future
  application shows a workflow satisfying all 5 preconditions but
  where the 8-step workflow is *not* load-bearing, the preconditions
  are necessary but not sufficient. Status: **not active** as of
  write-time.
- **F-CUM-4** (atlas/state/inventory leakage): if this synthesis
  triggers any modification of `state/proposals/inventory.json`,
  `shared/n6/atlas.n6`, `theory/canon/`,
  `theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`,
  or any `.claude/agents/*` file, the read-only scope is violated.
  Status: **not active**; this synthesis edits only its own output
  file. Pre-existing modifications in `gitStatus`
  (`reports/sessions/specs/...`, `state/proposals/inventory.json`)
  predate the synthesis and are unrelated.
- **F-CUM-5** (claim-creep at synthesis layer): if this synthesis is
  read as advancing any Millennium BT, any auxiliary lemma, or any
  proposal-inventory entry, the methodology→claim distinction has
  been violated. Status: **not active**; §0 explicitly disclaims and
  §7 honest assessment explicitly counts 0 Millennium resolutions.
- **F-CUM-6** (instantiate-the-pattern recursion at meta-meta layer):
  if the synthesis itself is treated as a 7th meta-pattern or
  triggers a meta-meta-cumulative synthesis in real time, the
  single-pass retrospective scope is violated. Status: **not active**;
  the synthesis is single-pass and explicitly registers AL3 against
  this expansion.
- **F-CUM-7** (pattern-citation fabrication): each of the 6 meta-pattern
  citations in §2 must be sourced to a real session report under
  `reports/sessions/`, with verbatim claim or §-section reference.
  Status: **not active**; all citations were Read against the source
  files during synthesis writing. Pattern 3's "3-pillar" framing is
  triangulated across `omega-exec-bt544-d3-A-axis-discriminator`,
  `omega-exec-bt544-exta-uomega-gradflow-validation`, and
  `omega-exec-bt544-extb-cilyap-validation`; no standalone "3-pillar"
  synthesis report exists, and §2.3 explicitly notes this triangulation.
- **F-CUM-8** (workflow-step omission): if any of the 8 steps in §3
  is shown to be redundant or absent from any of the parent reports'
  workflows, the unified-workflow claim is overstated. Status: **not
  active**; spot-checked against parent reports during synthesis.
- **F-CUM-9** (limitation-omission): if a major limitation of the
  synthesis is omitted from §5, the limitations list is incomplete.
  Status: **not active**; §5 covers n=2/n=4/single-session/method-gap/
  framework-artifact/short-window/H_observer-induction. Future
  identification of additional limitations would expand §5 without
  voiding the synthesis.
- **F-CUM-OMEGA** (meta): if a future independent meta-audit on this
  synthesis itself (e.g. critique of the 6-pattern enumeration, the
  8-step workflow, or §7 honest assessment) returns a substantively
  different conclusion, this report re-opens. Status: **not active**;
  future-trigger only.

None of F-CUM-1..9 or F-CUM-OMEGA fires under this report's scope.

## §10 Closing

**0/7 unchanged. Session-output is methodological refinement. No
atlas/state/inventory edits.**

The 2026-04-25 omega-cycle session in `canon` produced 61
reports / 33,548 lines / 6 meta-patterns / 1 unified 8-step workflow
/ 1 REPO_INVARIANT honesty triad result / 0 Millennium resolutions.
The cumulative methodology consolidates the six meta-patterns into a
transferable workflow with 5 preconditions, three counterfactual
cases where the workflow does not apply, three predictions for
hypothetical Lean4 / Rust / SaaS ports, and ten anti-patterns
explicitly rejected.

The session's primary output is **methodological refinement** —
disciplined characterization of how LLM-driven mathematical research
workflows can produce reliable verdicts and informative obstruction
maps, even when no Clay-class resolution is achieved. The
mathematical content (BT-546 96% concentration, R5 α(s) closure, R5
strict-gap PASS_LITERATURE, D3.A axis A 12-step sketch) is small
relative to the methodological output, and this is honestly framed
as a feature: LLM-driven sessions are more likely to characterize
difficulty than to resolve it, and characterization is reusable.

R1 Lemma 1 remains open at OBSTRUCTION_DOCUMENTED_LEVEL_4 (method
gap). α*_NS remains UNKNOWN. C3 remains a live conjecture with
falsifiers F-C3-A..C inactive. BT-544 remains 0/1 untouched. BT-541,
542, 543, 545, 546 remain at the verdict their per-report dispatches
recorded. BT-547 Poincaré is Perelman-resolved upstream of n6-arch;
n6-arch contribution is 0. Clay status unchanged.

The honesty triad (promotion-counter clamp / write-barrier /
no-fabrication guard) is preserved across the entire session and
across both repos (n6 + nexus). It is the load-bearing base layer
without which none of the other patterns produces reliable verdicts.

millennium_resolved: **0/7** (unchanged).
nxs_promotion_count: **unchanged this session** (no inventory writes).
NO atlas/state/inventory edits in n6 or nexus. NO CLAUDE.md changes.
NO `.claude/agents/*` changes. The single output file is this report
under
`~/core/canon/reports/sessions/omega-meta-cumulative-session-methodology-2026-04-25.md`.
