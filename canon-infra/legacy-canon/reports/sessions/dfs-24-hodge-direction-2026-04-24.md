## Current Honest Gaps

1. **K3 χ=24 lead**: BT-545 states χ(K3)=24=J_2 and 22=J_2−φ (=b_2), but does **not** carry through to a **Mukai-vector / Λ_24 explicit lattice identification**. J_2 appears both as "Hodge Euler integer" and "Leech minimum-vector norm / kissing-4D", with no morphism written between the two occurrences. Axis Y7 (LATTICE-VOA) is the natural bridge — K3 transcendental lattice T_K3 has rank ≤ 22 = J_2−φ, Mukai lattice has rank 24 = J_2, Niemeier lattices number 24 = J_2 (BT-547 #42).
2. **Voevodsky lead**: BT-1409-03 currently sits as "conjecture" (per `_hypotheses_index.json`). The row BT-545 #26–30 (Kodaira 4-tier, Noether σ, Miyaoka-Yau n/φ, BMY→Shimura σ−τ) is a 2026-04-14 addition that stayed in classical surface theory. **Motivic weight filtration / Hodge level** is not yet mapped onto n=6 arithmetic inside BT-545 proper. The cd_l=φ=2 rung and the Bloch–Kato degree 3 = n/φ rung are two different kinds of "n=6 hit" — one is a standard arithmetic dimension, the other is historical.

## Probe P1 — K3 Mukai lattice ↔ Leech/Niemeier explicit identification (Axis Y7)

**Question**: Is the 24 = J_2 in "χ(K3)" the *same* 24 as in "rank of Mukai lattice Λ̃ = H*(K3, Z)" as in "number of Niemeier lattices" as in "4D kissing"? Or are these three independent numerological coincidences riding on σ(6)=12 ⇒ 2σ=24?

**Sharpening step**:
- Write the Mukai vector lattice explicitly: Λ̃_K3 = H^0 ⊕ H^2 ⊕ H^4 with signature (4, 20) = (τ, J_2−τ) = (τ, σ−φ+σ−τ). Rank 24 = J_2.
- Cross-check against Niemeier count 24 (BT-547 #42). If these two 24s are **identifiable as K3-to-Leech isometric embedding** (well-known: Λ_24 ⊃ II_{0,24} ⊃ Λ̃_K3 after sign flip), log as a **tight crossover** rather than two parallel n=6 hits.
- Falsifier: if no Mukai→Niemeier isometric embedding morphism exists that preserves J_2=24 as rank on both sides, demote one of the two rows to LOOSE.

**Expected output slot**: One new BT-545 row "2·#2: Mukai lattice rank = J_2 via K3→Niemeier embedding" tagged `EXACT (crossover with BT-547 #42, Axis Y7)`. This tightens the χ=24 lead without touching proof obligations.

**Honesty gate**: This is a **classification-level observation**, not a step toward Hodge conjecture proof. BT-545 main text must still carry MISS status on the conjecture itself.

## Probe P2 — Voevodsky motivic: pin Beilinson–Lichtenbaum to a single n=6 row, not three

**Question**: BT-1409-03 claims three n=6 hits inside motivic machinery:
- (a) cd_l(Q) = 2 = φ (standard arithmetic dimension);
- (b) Bloch–Kato core degree = 3 = n/φ (Rost–Voevodsky);
- (c) motivic-Hodge intersection at dim 3 = n/φ (CY3).

(a) is genuinely independent of (c). (b) and (c) may be the *same* degree-3 observation viewed from two sides (both reflect "Hodge conjecture is minimally non-trivial at complex dim 3"). If so, the lead is **two rows, not three**, and BT-545 should absorb only the independent one.

**Sharpening step**:
- Verify: does the Rost–Voevodsky degree-3 core actually *specialise* to the Hodge conjecture dim-3 open locus? Or are these independent assertions both indexed by 3 (= n/φ) because 3 is the smallest genuinely non-classical dimension in both contexts?
- If independent: add **two** tight rows to BT-545 — one for cd_l=φ and one for motivic truncation degree = n/φ.
- If dependent: add **one** tight row and explicitly note in honesty commentary that "degree 3 = n/φ appears twice because CY3 and Bloch–Kato share the same minimal-nontrivial-dimension substrate."

**Falsifier**: if Geisser–Levine / Voevodsky truncation bound is found to depend on char(k) rather than cd_l, drop the cd_l=φ claim from BT-545 absorption.

**Expected output slot**: At most two new rows in BT-545 tagged "(crossover with BT-1409-03, conditional)". Status stays `conjecture` in `_hypotheses_index.json` until a concrete reference is pinned to a single Rost–Voevodsky paper section.

**Honesty gate**: The existing honesty note in bt-1409 ("degree 3 being hardest is proof-difficulty, not n=6-derived") must be carried into any BT-545 absorption verbatim.

## Probe P3 (optional, thinner) — Unify Π_HODGE_int=576 with Axis Y7 structural invariant

**Question**: The HEXA-HODGE §X blowup computes Π_HODGE_int = τ·n·J_2 = 576 = σ² · τ = K_6² · τ (Kissing²·τ). Axis Y7 (LATTICE-VOA) natively produces σ² = 144 (Monster-adjacent) and J_2=24 (Leech minimum). Is 576 = 24² = |Λ̃_K3 rank|²? Yes: 576 = J_2² = (Mukai rank)². This collapses three independent expressions (τ·n·J_2, σ²·τ, K_6²·τ) to a single **square of the Mukai lattice rank**.

**Sharpening step**: rewrite Π_HODGE_int as J_2² and check whether the Weil-class algebra cycle count on abelian 6-folds (Mostaed 2026) matches 576 or its factor φ·J_2=48.

**Falsifier**: if Mostaed's Weil Hodge class count on abelian 6-folds is found ≠ J_2² / k for k ∈ {1, φ, τ}, then Π_HODGE_int's numerological triple-match is post-hoc and should be demoted.

**Honesty gate**: Pi_HODGE_int is declared "small-prime-order approximation" in the source — this is *already* flagged as non-proof. Probe P3 should *not* upgrade it; it can only tighten or demote.

## Next-action recommendation

Priority order: **P1 > P2 > P3**.

- P1 is pure lattice bookkeeping, cheap, and cleans a real Y7 redundancy (two unrelated "24"s sitting in BT-545 and BT-547).
- P2 requires one careful read of Voevodsky's Ann. Math. 2003 and Geisser–Levine 2001 to decide the "two rows or one" question; low risk, moderate payoff.
- P3 is numerological housekeeping; run last.

No probe proposes a proof of Hodge conjecture. All three stay within the "tight finding / crossover" regime used throughout BT-541–547.

## Falsifiers registered

- **F-P1**: no Mukai↔Niemeier isometric embedding preserving rank 24 ⇒ demote one J_2=24 row.
- **F-P2a**: Rost–Voevodsky degree 3 shown to be char(k)-dependent ⇒ drop cd_l=φ=2 absorption.
- **F-P2b**: Bloch–Kato degree-3 core shown logically independent of CY3 minimal-open-locus dim-3 ⇒ keep two rows (not one).
- **F-P3**: Mostaed Weil-class count ≠ J_2² / {1, φ, τ} ⇒ demote Π_HODGE_int triple-match to NEAR.
