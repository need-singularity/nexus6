# Phase 4 Batch Plan — reports/ track (284 files, 14 batches)

**Date**: 2026-04-25
**Author**: Phase 4 planner (automated)
**Status**: planning only — no code edits in this proposal
**Scope**: adds only this plan under `reports/sessions/`; allowlist and reports/**/*.md files remain untouched
**Compliance**:
- own#1 (doc-english-hard): this file under `reports/` is in own#1 scope and must be CJK-free. Verified by `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1`.
- own#11 (bt-solution-claim-ban): targets described as "draft/target/candidate" only. No "solved"/"proven" claims.
- own#17 (README English-only): out of scope for this plan.

---

## 1. Context

Source roadmap: `proposals/own1-hard-english-only-translation-roadmap-2026-04-24.md`.

Completed phases (merged on origin/main = `ef246bc6`):

- Phase 0: bridge/ + +canonshared/ (10 files)
- Phase 1: proposals/ (9 files)
- Phase 2: experiments/ (25 files)
- Phase 3: domains/ priority (200 files) — allowlist 1015 -> 815

Phase 4 scope: all 284 `reports/` entries currently on the own#1 legacy allowlist. Target allowlist reduction after Phase 4 completion: 815 -> 531.

## 2. Priority Criteria

The roadmap does not enumerate a precise 284-file reports/ set; the documented fallback rule is applied:

1. Enumerate all `reports/` allowlist entries (284 confirmed).
2. Group by first-level subdirectory (breakthroughs/, audits/, sessions/, discovery/, top-level reports/*.md, plus small buckets changelogs/, meta/, templates/, validation/).
3. Within each subdirectory sort by CJK character count ascending (shortest first = easier starter wins, reduces allowlist race duration per batch).
4. Pack into 14 batches: 13 batches of exactly 20 files plus 1 tail batch of 24 files (balance: 13*20 + 24 = 284).
5. Preserve subtree contiguity where possible; allow cross-subtree "tail+head" batches at subdirectory boundaries to keep batch sizes uniform.

Deviation note vs. pure per-subtree packing:
- Subtree sizes are not multiples of 20. Five boundary batches (B6, B9, B11, B13, B14) each span two adjacent subtrees.
- The small buckets (changelogs=3, meta=2, templates=2, validation=1; 8 files total) are pooled into the final tail batch B14 along with the reports/*.md top-level tail.

## 4. Batch Overview

| Batch | Label | Files | CJK Total | Primary Subtree |

| 13 | `phase-4-13-discovery-tail-reports-top-a` | 20 | 21055 | reports/discovery/ + reports/*.md |
| 14 | `phase-4-14-reports-top-b-misc` | 24 | 24765 | reports/*.md + reports/{changelogs,meta,templates,validation}/ |
| **Total** | — | **284** | **394425** | — |

Note on CJK-per-batch: Phase 4 processes larger/denser files than Phase 3 (breakthroughs/ and sessions/ include long-form reports). Average is ~28k CJK/batch; outliers B5 (50k), B6 (73k), B11 (63k) carry the per-subtree tails. Per the "outliers OK" clause established in Phase 2, these are acceptable.

## 5. Parallelism Coordination Notes (allowlist race pattern)

All 14 batch agents will attempt to edit the shared file `tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json`. The following mitigation pattern, proven in Phase 2 and Phase 3, is MANDATORY. See `reports/sessions/hard-english-only-session-2026-04-24.md` section 11.6 for the full post-mortem (stash-wipeout race, allowlist re-introduction race, post-write CJK verify requirement).

1. **Read-modify-write with mtime check**: capture `os.stat(path).st_mtime_ns` before read; re-check after edit is staged but before commit. If mtime changed, re-pull and re-apply removal set.
2. **Removal set, not index-based edits**: each agent computes the set of paths to remove (its batch files). Re-apply idempotently (`[e for e in allowlist if e not in removal_set]`). Never use positional indices.
3. **`_meta.count` resync**: after editing `allowlist`, set `_meta.count = len(allowlist)` unconditionally.
4. **Rebase-retry loop on push**: `git pull --rebase origin main`, max 3 retries. On rebase conflict in the allowlist JSON, resolve by accepting theirs + re-applying our removal set (our entries are a disjoint subset).
5. **Stash/pop on dirty tree**: if rebase complains about uncommitted changes (e.g., pre-commit hook left artifacts), `git stash push -u`, rebase, `git stash pop`. Always `pop` after rebase to avoid the stash-wipeout race documented in session log section 11.6.
6. **Post-write CJK re-verify**: after `git stash pop` or any rebase-merge resolution, re-run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1` before commit. A rebase may re-introduce CJK content from concurrent sibling batches.
7. **Pre-commit hook race**: `--no-verify` is permitted after the agent has locally run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1` and confirmed pass. This is explicitly authorized ONLY under that precondition.
8. **Staging hygiene**: `git add` only the translated `.md` files + `tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json`. Never `git add -A` or `git add .`.
9. **own#11 softener vocabulary**: use "draft", "candidate", "pattern", "target" when describing results. Never "solved", "proven", "complete", "finished", "confirmed" in a claim-asserting sense.
10. **Preservation rules**: code fences verbatim, math blocks (`$...$`, `$$...$$`) verbatim, YAML frontmatter keys verbatim, hyperlinks and image paths verbatim, technical identifiers as-is: atlas, ouroboros, sigma, phi, J2, @R/@P/@C/@L, BT-*, M10*, HEXA-*, N6-*, own#N.

## 7. Per-Batch Launch Prompt Templates

Each block below is a paste-ready prompt for a single agent. Do not edit; copy-paste verbatim into a fresh agent session. Replace the per-batch file list only if you want to re-split batches.

### Prompt for Batch 1: `phase-4-1-breakthroughs-a`

```
You are a Phase 4 translation agent for the canon own#1 HARD English-only campaign.

Repo: ~/core/canon
Branch: main (rebase against origin/main as needed)
Batch label: phase-4-1-breakthroughs-a
Batch number: 1 of 14

## Task

1. For each file, translate all Korean/CJK text to English in-place, preserving:
   - All markdown structure (headers, lists, tables, blockquotes, code fences)
   - All math blocks ($...$, $$...$$) verbatim
   - All code blocks verbatim
   - All frontmatter keys verbatim
   - All hyperlinks and image paths verbatim
   - Technical terms as-is: atlas, ouroboros, sigma, phi, J2, @R/@P/@C/@L, BT-*, M10*, HEXA-*, N6-*, own#N
2. own#11 compliance: describe all results as "draft/candidate/pattern/target". Do NOT write "solved", "proven", "complete", "finished", "confirmed" in a claim-asserting sense. If the source document used such claim words, soften to "draft candidate / pattern target".
3. After all files are translated, edit `tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json`:
   - Remove exactly the paths in this batch from the `allowlist` array
   - Set `_meta.count = len(allowlist)`
   - Keep JSON formatting style (2-space indent, trailing newline)
4. Allowlist race mitigation (MANDATORY; see session log 2026-04-24 section 11.6):
   - Read mtime before edit; re-read after edit if mtime changed
   - Use set-based removal (disjoint subset); never positional
   - On push conflict: `git pull --rebase origin main`, max 3 retries
   - On rebase conflict in allowlist JSON: accept theirs, re-apply removal set
   - On dirty tree during rebase: `git stash push -u`, rebase, `git stash pop`
   - After `git stash pop` or any merge resolution: re-run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1` (post-write CJK verify — a rebase can re-introduce CJK from sibling batches)
5. Local validation before commit:
   - Run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1`
   - If non-zero exit, ABORT (do not commit). Fix remaining CJK or re-run translation on the failing file.

## Task

1. For each file, translate all Korean/CJK text to English in-place, preserving:
   - All markdown structure (headers, lists, tables, blockquotes, code fences)
   - All math blocks ($...$, $$...$$) verbatim
   - All code blocks verbatim
   - All frontmatter keys verbatim
   - All hyperlinks and image paths verbatim
   - Technical terms as-is: atlas, ouroboros, sigma, phi, J2, @R/@P/@C/@L, BT-*, M10*, HEXA-*, N6-*, own#N
2. own#11 compliance: describe all results as "draft/candidate/pattern/target". Do NOT write "solved", "proven", "complete", "finished", "confirmed" in a claim-asserting sense. If the source document used such claim words, soften to "draft candidate / pattern target".
3. After all files are translated, edit `tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json`:
   - Remove exactly the paths in this batch from the `allowlist` array
   - Set `_meta.count = len(allowlist)`
   - Keep JSON formatting style (2-space indent, trailing newline)
4. Allowlist race mitigation (MANDATORY; see session log 2026-04-24 section 11.6):
   - Read mtime before edit; re-read after edit if mtime changed
   - Use set-based removal (disjoint subset); never positional
   - On push conflict: `git pull --rebase origin main`, max 3 retries
   - On rebase conflict in allowlist JSON: accept theirs, re-apply removal set
   - On dirty tree during rebase: `git stash push -u`, rebase, `git stash pop`
   - After `git stash pop` or any merge resolution: re-run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1` (post-write CJK verify — a rebase can re-introduce CJK from sibling batches)
5. Local validation before commit:
   - Run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1`
   - If non-zero exit, ABORT (do not commit). Fix remaining CJK or re-run translation on the failing file.
6. Staging:
   - `git add` only the translated `.md` files in this batch and `tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json`
   - Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`
7. Commit (two commits, not one):
   - Commit A: `docs(translate): phase-4-2 phase-4-2-breakthroughs-b (20 files)` — staged .md files only

   - If pre-commit hook race triggers on sibling files (other batches running), `--no-verify` is permitted ONLY after you have locally verified `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1` passes.

## Task

1. For each file, translate all Korean/CJK text to English in-place, preserving:
   - All markdown structure (headers, lists, tables, blockquotes, code fences)
   - All math blocks ($...$, $$...$$) verbatim
   - All code blocks verbatim
   - All frontmatter keys verbatim
   - All hyperlinks and image paths verbatim
   - Technical terms as-is: atlas, ouroboros, sigma, phi, J2, @R/@P/@C/@L, BT-*, M10*, HEXA-*, N6-*, own#N
2. own#11 compliance: describe all results as "draft/candidate/pattern/target". Do NOT write "solved", "proven", "complete", "finished", "confirmed" in a claim-asserting sense. If the source document used such claim words, soften to "draft candidate / pattern target".
3. After all files are translated, edit `tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json`:
   - Remove exactly the paths in this batch from the `allowlist` array
   - Set `_meta.count = len(allowlist)`
   - Keep JSON formatting style (2-space indent, trailing newline)
4. Allowlist race mitigation (MANDATORY; see session log 2026-04-24 section 11.6):
   - Read mtime before edit; re-read after edit if mtime changed
   - Use set-based removal (disjoint subset); never positional
   - On push conflict: `git pull --rebase origin main`, max 3 retries
   - On rebase conflict in allowlist JSON: accept theirs, re-apply removal set
   - On dirty tree during rebase: `git stash push -u`, rebase, `git stash pop`
   - After `git stash pop` or any merge resolution: re-run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1` (post-write CJK verify — a rebase can re-introduce CJK from sibling batches)
5. Local validation before commit:
   - Run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1`
   - If non-zero exit, ABORT (do not commit). Fix remaining CJK or re-run translation on the failing file.
6. Staging:
   - `git add` only the translated `.md` files in this batch and `tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json`
   - Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`
7. Commit (two commits, not one):
   - Commit A: `docs(translate): phase-4-6 phase-4-6-breakthroughs-tail-audits-a (20 files)` — staged .md files only
   - Commit B: `feat(own): shrink own#1 allowlist phase-4-6` — staged allowlist JSON only
   - If pre-commit hook race triggers on sibling files (other batches running), `--no-verify` is permitted ONLY after you have locally verified `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1` passes.
8. Push:
   - `git push origin main`
   - On rejection, `git pull --rebase origin main` then retry (max 3 total attempts)

## Report back

- Commit SHAs for Commit A and Commit B
- Final allowlist count (should be 815 minus shrinkage from this and concurrent batches)
- Any files that failed translation and were deferred
- own_doc_lint.py --rule 1 exit code at commit time

## Task

1. For each file, translate all Korean/CJK text to English in-place, preserving:
   - All markdown structure (headers, lists, tables, blockquotes, code fences)
   - All math blocks ($...$, $$...$$) verbatim
   - All code blocks verbatim
   - All frontmatter keys verbatim
   - All hyperlinks and image paths verbatim
   - Technical terms as-is: atlas, ouroboros, sigma, phi, J2, @R/@P/@C/@L, BT-*, M10*, HEXA-*, N6-*, own#N
2. own#11 compliance: describe all results as "draft/candidate/pattern/target". Do NOT write "solved", "proven", "complete", "finished", "confirmed" in a claim-asserting sense. If the source document used such claim words, soften to "draft candidate / pattern target".
3. After all files are translated, edit `tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json`:
   - Remove exactly the paths in this batch from the `allowlist` array
   - Set `_meta.count = len(allowlist)`
   - Keep JSON formatting style (2-space indent, trailing newline)
4. Allowlist race mitigation (MANDATORY; see session log 2026-04-24 section 11.6):
   - Read mtime before edit; re-read after edit if mtime changed
   - Use set-based removal (disjoint subset); never positional
   - On push conflict: `git pull --rebase origin main`, max 3 retries
   - On rebase conflict in allowlist JSON: accept theirs, re-apply removal set
   - On dirty tree during rebase: `git stash push -u`, rebase, `git stash pop`
   - After `git stash pop` or any merge resolution: re-run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1` (post-write CJK verify — a rebase can re-introduce CJK from sibling batches)
5. Local validation before commit:
   - Run `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1`
   - If non-zero exit, ABORT (do not commit). Fix remaining CJK or re-run translation on the failing file.
6. Staging:
   - `git add` only the translated `.md` files in this batch and `tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json`
   - Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`
7. Commit (two commits, not one):
   - Commit A: `docs(translate): phase-4-11 phase-4-11-sessions-tail-discovery-a (20 files)` — staged .md files only
   - Commit B: `feat(own): shrink own#1 allowlist phase-4-11` — staged allowlist JSON only
   - If pre-commit hook race triggers on sibling files (other batches running), `--no-verify` is permitted ONLY after you have locally verified `python3 tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1` passes.
8. Push:
   - `git push origin main`
   - On rejection, `git pull --rebase origin main` then retry (max 3 total attempts)

## Report back

- Commit SHAs for Commit A and Commit B
- Final allowlist count (should be 815 minus shrinkage from this and concurrent batches)
- Any files that failed translation and were deferred
- own_doc_lint.py --rule 1 exit code at commit time
```

## 8. Post-Phase-4 Target State

- Allowlist count: 815 -> 531 (all 284 reports/ entries removed)
- Remaining subtrees on allowlist (approximate, pending Phase 4 execution):
  - domains/ residual (~217 files, non-priority longer-form documents)
  - Other subtrees as enumerated in the roadmap
- Next wave: Phase 5 (domains/ residual + remaining sub-trees per roadmap).
