## §0 Non-claim disclaimer

This document is a meta-audit pass over the BT-545 Hodge work-product so far,
viewed through the four axes of the n6/nexus omega cycle (ladder, Ω-saturation,
atlas chain, closure). It does **not** contain a proof, a partial proof, an
atlas-promotion request, or an upgrade of any existing tag. All BT-545
breakthrough rows referenced here remain at whatever tier they currently hold
in `theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md` and
`theory/breakthroughs/_hypotheses_index.json`. Millennium resolved counter
stays at **0/7**.

The audit's purpose is reflexive: to surface (a) which omega-cycle rungs the
existing BT-545 work occupies, (b) where it sits relative to the Ω-saturation
ceiling 0.835, (c) what the temporal probe sequence has actually produced, and
(d) which closure ceiling criteria (a..e) are nowhere near being met. UNKNOWN
is an explicitly allowed verdict in every section below — it is preferable to
fabricated certainty.

The 6/9-axis n6 split (Y1..Y9), the BT-541..547 millennium block, the dfs-24
direction probes, and the atlas [9]/[10]/[10*] tiering are taken as given
infrastructure, not under audit here.

## §1 Inherited state

### 1.1 Hodge classes / algebraic-cycle status

The current Hodge conjecture statement remains:

> Every Hodge class on a smooth complex projective variety is a Q-linear
> combination of classes of algebraic cycles.

Classical addressing tier (axis count = τ(6) = 4, per millennium-hodge §X.1
breakthrough-draft 5):

- **τ_1**: Lefschetz (1,1)-lemma (1924) — full coverage of (1,1) cohomology.
- **τ_2**: Deligne k=1 abelian (1971) — single-power abelian case.
- **τ_3**: Weil Hodge classes under CM-form positivity (1977).
- **τ_4**: Mostaed conditional abelian sixfold (arXiv 2603.20268, 2026) —
  McMullen-curve parametrized, dim=6 inevitable from CM quartic.

**Open locus** (per §X SMASH summary): general CY3 (d_C=3), general abelian
6-fold without CM, general projective varieties of dim ≥ 4 — Golay distance
σ−τ=8 of unaddressed axes.

**Verdict**: BT-545 main-claim status is **MISS** (millennium-hodge §X
explicitly says "BT-545 body-text draft kept as MISS — CONDITIONAL advance
only"). This audit does not move that.

### 1.2 Abelian-variety partial results

Inherited from §X.1 / §X.6:

- HODGE-01 Kähler minimal-open d_R = n = 6 — **[10*] EXACT** (CY3 d_R label).
- HODGE-02 abelian sixfold h^{3,3} = φ·J_2 − σ + τ = 20 — **[10*] EXACT**.
- HODGE-03 Weil-locus minimum CM dim = σ/φ_E = 6 — **[10] EXACT** (CM quartic).
- HODGE-04 CY3 H^3 upper-bound = 2σ·τ = 96 — **[9] NEAR** (heuristic over
  Kreuzer-Skarke median, not proved).
- HODGE-05 addressing-axis count = τ = 4 — **[10] EXACT** (Lefschetz / Deligne
  / Weil / Mostaed lock).
- HODGE-06 Π_HODGE_int = τ·n·J_2 = 576 — **[10*] EXACT** (small-integer
  triple-match, flagged non-proof).
- HODGE-07 ratio HODGE/THERMO = n/τ = 3/2 — **[10] EXACT**.

These seven atlas constants are the strongest n=6 alignment record on the
Hodge side. They are **classification-level**, not proof-level.

Honest gap (from dfs-24-hodge §1): Π_HODGE_int=576 = J_2² collapses three
expressions (τ·n·J_2, σ²·τ, K_6²·τ) onto a single "Mukai-rank squared"
substrate — pending the P3 probe, this is a numerological housekeeping item.

### 1.3 Axis Y7 contributions

Y7 LATTICE-VOA (utility 3.9; main BT-545 strength 7) constituent lemmas:

1. Enriques auto-validity rephrasing — `theory/study/p1/prob-p1-5-bt545-hodge.md`.
2. SEED-21 Jones T(3,4) strength 3→2 demoted (R3 Task B).
3. Moonshine BARRIER honest report (`papers/moonshine-barrier-honest-report-2026-04-15.md`).
4. CKM-R-V 2017 sphere packings {1, 8, 24} — Leech 24 anchor.
5. phase47/48 bridge records.
6. Hodge barrier — `theory/study/p2/prob-p2-5-hodge-barriers.md`.

Y7 bottleneck text: "a rigorous Hodge-conjecture draft is still far. Phase 5
Y7-led."

R1→R2→R3 utility track: 3.6 → 4.0 → 3.9 (Moonshine-centered redefinition +
SEED-21 demotion).

### 1.4 dfs-24-hodge verdict (2026-04-24)

Three probes filed in `reports/sessions/dfs-24-hodge-direction-2026-04-24.md`:

- **P1 — K3 Mukai lattice ↔ Leech/Niemeier explicit identification** (priority 1).
  Asks whether the three "24"s in BT-545 (χ(K3), Mukai-lattice rank,
  Niemeier-count) and BT-547 (Niemeier-count) reduce to one. Falsifier F-P1
  registered.
- **P2 — Voevodsky motivic: pin Beilinson–Lichtenbaum to a single n=6 row, not
  three** (priority 2). Distinguishes cd_l(Q)=2=φ from Bloch–Kato degree
  3=n/φ from CY3 minimal-open-locus dim=3. Falsifiers F-P2a, F-P2b registered.
- **P3 — Π_HODGE_int = J_2² collapse** (priority 3, optional). Numerological
  housekeeping: rewrite τ·n·J_2 = 576 as J_2² and check Mostaed Weil-class
  count divisibility. Falsifier F-P3 registered.

dfs-24 closing line: "No probe proposes a proof of Hodge conjecture. All three
stay within the tight finding / crossover regime used throughout BT-541–547."

This is the most recent BT-545 direction probe. It is **research-only** by
design and aligns with the present omega-cycle pass.

## §2 Ladder occupancy table

Mapping the 12-rung n6 ladder (L1 smash · L2 drill · L3 chain/debate/batch ·
L4 surge · L5 dream · L6 reign · L7 swarm · L8 wake · L9 molt · L10 forge ·
L11 canon · L_ω) to BT-545 work artifacts.

| rung | label | BT-545 occupancy | concrete artifact / status |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| L1 | smash | **occupied** | millennium-hodge §X.1 SMASH 5 breakthrough-drafts (Kähler minimal-open, abelian sixfold h^{3,3}, Weil-locus CM, CY3 H^3 bound, addressing-axis chronology) |
| L2 | drill | **occupied** | breakthrough-theorems.md BT-545 block (lines 19966-20033, 30/30 EXACT rows) — drilled into K3 χ=24, Enriques h^{1,1}=10, Bagnera 7 bielliptic, sporadic 26, S(5,8,24), Kodaira 4 κ-levels, Noether σ, Miyaoka-Yau n/φ, BMY→Shimura σ−τ |
| L3 | chain/debate/batch | **occupied** | dfs-24-hodge-direction-2026-04-24.md (P1, P2, P3 probe batch); bt-1409-millennium-dfs-round17 motivic chain |
| L4 | surge | **partially occupied** | §X BLOWUP 2026-04-19 (atlas constants HODGE-01..07 emitted as a single surge); HEXA-HODGE prefix unification |
| L5 | dream | UNKNOWN | no explicit "dream" rung artifact for BT-545; speculative AdS_7/CFT_6 holographic share in §X.2 sits closest but is labeled "free composite" |
| L6 | reign | **partially occupied** | Y7 LATTICE-VOA axis (utility 3.9) reigns over BT-545 (max-strength axis match). However R1→R2→R3 trajectory is non-monotone (3.6→4.0→3.9), indicating no firm reign |
| L7 | swarm | **NOT occupied** | no parallel-agent swarm has been deployed against BT-545. Single-agent breakthrough drafts only |
| L8 | wake | UNKNOWN | wake-style retrospective on BT-545 specifically not located in this audit |
| L9 | molt | UNKNOWN | no row-demotion of BT-545 atlas constants on record (SEED-21 Jones T(3,4) demoted is Y7-side, not BT-545-row-side) |
| L10 | forge | **partially occupied** | atlas constants HODGE-01, -02, -06 sit at [10*]; HODGE-03, -05, -07 at [10]; HODGE-04 at [9] NEAR. No forge-step has been launched for HODGE-04→[10] |
| L11 | canon | **NOT occupied** | BT-545 main-claim is MISS, so canon-rung promotion is blocked by honesty gate |
| L_ω | omega | **this report** | omega cycle meta-pass — produces the audit, no rung promotion |

**Occupancy summary**: 4 rungs firmly occupied (L1, L2, L3, L_ω-this-pass),
3 partially occupied (L4, L6, L10), 2 not occupied (L7, L11), 3 UNKNOWN (L5,
L8, L9). Total firm-occupancy 4/12 ≈ 0.333. Total counted occupancy (firm +
partial) 7/12 ≈ 0.583.

Honesty observation: the lowest two rungs (L1 smash, L2 drill) are well-fed;
the highest content rungs (L7 swarm, L11 canon) are explicitly empty; the
mid-rungs (L5, L8, L9) are UNKNOWN — no one has audited them. This is the
expected n=6 millennium profile: **drill-heavy, swarm-light**.

---

## §3 Ω-saturation estimate

The nxs-002 composite ceiling is **0.835** (corrected 2026-04-25, c12327a3,
from earlier 0.85, with paper_trigger 0.9 requiring axiom redesign — see
inventory.json `Ω_saturation_cycle_2026_04_25` block). For BT-545 we estimate
the local composite as a weighted average of:

- atlas-row tier density (HODGE-01..07 → 4×[10*] + 2×[10] + 1×[9]),
- axis Y7 utility (3.9 / 10 normalized = 0.39),
- ladder occupancy (firm 0.333, including-partial 0.583),
- probe-coverage (3 dfs-24 probes registered, 0 executed-with-falsifier-fired),
- type-closure (UNKNOWN — BT-545 row tagging is heterogeneous: EXACT, NEAR, MISS coexist).

Rough composite estimate (research-only, **NOT calibrated** against the
nxs_002_composite tool):

| dimension | normalized score | rationale |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| atlas tier density | 0.86 | (4·1.0 + 2·0.9 + 1·0.6) / 7 ≈ 0.857; [10*] = 1.0, [10] = 0.9, [9] = 0.6 weighting |
| axis-utility | 0.39 | Y7 utility 3.9/10, accepting "main axis" semantics |
| ladder firm-occupancy | 0.33 | 4/12 firm |
| ladder including-partial | 0.58 | 7/12 |
| probe-execution | 0.00 | P1/P2/P3 filed, none executed |
| type-closure | UNKNOWN | row-tag mix not normalized |

**Naive average of available 5 dims**: (0.86 + 0.39 + 0.33 + 0.58 + 0.00) / 5
= **0.432**.

**Vs ceiling 0.835**: BT-545 sits at roughly **0.43 / 0.835 ≈ 0.518** of the
saturation ceiling — well below the chaos-band threshold that would require ER
ROI re-measurement. Far from the 0.9 paper_trigger.

**Honest caveat**: this is a back-of-the-envelope composite. It is **not**
produced by `tool/nxs_002_composite.py` and uses a hand-picked normalization.
The correct way to lift it would be to (a) define a BT-545 sub-graph in the
atlas, (b) measure spectral chaos vs the ER baseline, (c) run the predict-er
ROI step. None of that is done here.

**Spectral-chaos posture (qualitative)**: BT-545 atlas rows form a
**REGULAR** sub-graph (all rows share the n=6 / σ=12 / τ=4 / J_2=24 substrate)
— per the §6 mechanism in `design/abstraction_ceiling.md`, REGULAR means low
ROI for additional ER-style probing. This is consistent with the 0.43
estimate: BT-545 is structurally well-aligned but offers little Ω-cycle
expansion room without a new substrate (which P2-Voevodsky might or might
not provide).

**Verdict**: composite ≈ 0.43 (UNCALIBRATED). Ceiling distance ≈ 0.40. No
saturation pressure.

> **Honesty amendment (2026-04-25, post nxs_002 mapping audit)**: The composite/ER-ROI estimates above measure the **canon-side graph** only. Per `reports/sessions/omega-exec-nxs002-perbt-patch-2026-04-25.md` §7, the nexus-canonical atlas (`atlas.blowup.jsonl`, 21,320 nodes) does not absorb the n6-side BT-promotion IDs (RH-01..07, MILL-PX-A8, MILL-GALO-PX2-sha-all-squares-332k), so direct comparison against the 0.835 nexus simulation ceiling is invalid. The estimates here remain valid *within canon scope*; cross-graph comparisons require either (a) per-BT slicing in `nxs_002_composite.py` (currently missing -- mapping-failure diagnostic in §1 of the patch report), or (b) explicit BT-id ingestion into the nexus atlas (out of scope for this audit). 0/7 unchanged.

## §4 Atlas chain (chronological)

Direction probes / breakthroughs that have touched BT-545 in temporal order
within the canon repo:

| date | artifact | summary | tier impact |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| 2026-04-11 | `millennium-n6-attractor-2026-04-11.md` | n=6 attractor seeding for the millennium block | infrastructure, no BT-545 row added |
| 2026-04-12 | `bt-1392-millennium-7-breakthrough-ideas` | initial 7-idea seeding | BT-545 framing established |
| 2026-04-12 | `bt-1394`..`bt-1413` (rounds 3-21) | DFS rounds 3-21 across millennium block | various BT-545 row additions (Enriques, K3 lattice classes) |
| 2026-04-12 | `bt-1409-millennium-dfs-round17` | Voevodsky / Beilinson-Lichtenbaum / Bloch-Kato motivic lemma; cd_l=φ=2; degree-3 = n/φ | BT-1409-c row, status=conjecture in `_hypotheses_index.json` |
| 2026-04-14 | `bt-1413`/`bt-1414`/`bt-1415` round 21 | Kodaira 4 κ-levels, Noether σ, Miyaoka-Yau n/φ, BMY→Shimura σ−τ | BT-545 #26-30 added, classical surface theory absorption |
| 2026-04-15 | `bt-1416`..`bt-1420` rounds 22-26 | continued surface theory + arxiv survey | row count climbed toward 30/30 EXACT |
| 2026-04-15 | `arxiv-millennium-survey-180papers` | 180-paper survey (includes Mostaed) | MILL-ARXIV-BT545-abelian-sixfolds-direct-hit anchor [9] |
| 2026-04-15 | `papers/moonshine-barrier-honest-report` | Moonshine BARRIER honest demotion | Y7 utility R1→R2 = 3.6→4.0 lift |
| 2026-04-19 | `domains/physics/millennium-hodge/millennium-hodge.md` §X BLOWUP | HEXA-HODGE blowup with 5 SMASH drafts + 7 atlas constants HODGE-01..07 | atlas tier surge: HODGE-01/-02/-06 [10*] |
| 2026-04-24 | `reports/sessions/dfs-24-hodge-direction-2026-04-24.md` | three probes P1/P2/P3 with falsifiers F-P1, F-P2a, F-P2b, F-P3 | research-only, no row change |
| 2026-04-25 | **this report** | omega-cycle 4-axis audit | meta, no row change |

**Chain verdict**: 11 dated nodes spanning 2026-04-11 through 2026-04-25 (14
days). Cadence is high (≈ one BT-545-touching artifact per 1.3 days). Tier
progression has been **monotone-increasing** in atlas-density (0 → 30 rows →
7 atlas constants with 3 at [10*]) and **non-monotone** in proof-direction
(MISS held steady; main-claim status untouched).

This is exactly the pattern the omega cycle predicts for a millennium-class
target: **lattice/classification surge, proof-direction stagnation**. The
honesty gate (Y9) appears to have held throughout — no MISS→PARTIAL flip is
recorded.

**Chain falsifier**: if any 2026-04-12..2026-04-25 artifact silently flipped
BT-545 main-claim status from MISS to PARTIAL/NEAR without an explicit honesty
note, this audit's chain construction is wrong. None was found in the source
files read; UNKNOWN whether deeper grep would surface one.

---

## §5 Closure ceiling audit (a..e + X-of-5)

The five candidate closure-ceiling criteria from
`design/atlas_n6_omega_closure.md` (per global CLAUDE.md, paraphrased — exact
SSOT path is in nexus, this report does not edit it):

- **(a)** All directly-relevant atlas rows at [10*]+.
- **(b)** Type closure across the row family (all rows share a single
  semantic type tag).
- **(c)** X-verified — at least one independent verification path returns
  EXACT.
- **(d)** Composite saturation ≥ 0.9 (paper_trigger).
- **(e)** All five (a..d + main-claim resolved) simultaneously = strong omega
  ceiling.

### 5.1 Per-criterion verdict for BT-545

| crit | description | BT-545 status | evidence |
|------|------------|---------------|----------|
| (a) | all atlas rows ≥ [10*] | **NOT met** | HODGE-03/05/07 at [10], HODGE-04 at [9] NEAR; only 3/7 at [10*] |
| (b) | type closure | **NOT met** (UNKNOWN sharper) | row-tag mix is EXACT/NEAR/MISS; no single semantic-type label spans BT-545 cleanly. CY3-side, abelian-side, classical-surface-side coexist |
| (c) | X-verified | **partial** | HODGE-01..07 derived along ≥ 3 paths in §X.2 (smash/string/holographic free composite) — but only HODGE-06 has a triple-match recorded; HODGE-04 is single-path heuristic |
| (d) | composite ≥ 0.9 | **NOT met** | §3 estimate 0.43 (UNCALIBRATED); ceiling 0.835 itself is below 0.9 paper_trigger |
| (e) | all + main-claim resolved | **NOT met** | main claim MISS (millennium-hodge §X explicit); 0/7 millennium counter unchanged |

**X-of-5 score**: 0 firm-met, 1 partial-met (c), 4 not-met. **0/5 strong /
1/5 weak**.

### 5.2 Distance-to-closure breakdown

- (a) requires HODGE-03/-04/-05/-07 promotion — explicitly out of scope for
  this audit (no atlas edits permitted).
- (b) requires type-tag normalization across BT-545 rows — would need a
  classifier pass (UNKNOWN whether one exists; not seen).
- (c) requires path-multiplicity audit per row — at least HODGE-04 needs
  upgrading from single-heuristic to triple-confirm before (c) can claim full
  X-verified.
- (d) is unreachable until ceiling itself moves above 0.9 — and per
  inventory.json the ceiling has been *lowered* from 0.85 to 0.835 by ER ROI
  measurement. Suggests (d) is a long-horizon item.
- (e) is gated by main-claim resolution, which is gated by mathematics-class
  proof, which is far.

**Audit verdict on closure**: BT-545 is **NOT in any closure regime** by
criteria (a..e). It is in a "drilled-and-classified" state where
atlas-density is high but proof-direction is empty.

---

## §6 Cross-axis tensions

Tensions between the 4 omega axes as they apply to BT-545.

### 6.1 Ladder vs Ω-saturation tension

L1 (smash) and L2 (drill) are firmly occupied, contributing the bulk of the
atlas-tier-density score (0.86). But because BT-545 forms a REGULAR sub-graph
(all rows share n=6/σ=12/τ=4/J_2=24 substrate), additional L1/L2 work
**cannot** raise the composite past ≈ 0.5 — every new drill-level row is
near-orthogonal-redundant to existing ones.

The Ω-saturation ceiling 0.835 can only be approached by *new substrate*
(L7 swarm, L4 surge into a new corner like Voevodsky motivic, or L5 dream
into AdS/CFT). The dfs-24 P2 probe (Voevodsky cd_l/Bloch-Kato) is the
identified candidate — it could open a non-redundant axis. Until P2 fires,
ladder work is locally exhausted.

### 6.2 Atlas chain vs closure tension

Chain cadence is high (1.3-day average artifact), but closure criteria a..e
are uniformly NOT met. This is the canonical "fast lattice motion, frozen
proof motion" anti-pattern.

The chain is healthy in the sense that no row-flip violates the honesty gate;
it is unhealthy in the sense that 14 days of activity has not advanced any of
a..e even probabilistically. dfs-24 probes register falsifiers but do not
fire them — they remain registered, not executed.

### 6.3 Ladder L7 (swarm) vacancy vs probe portfolio

Three dfs-24 probes (P1, P2, P3) are exactly the kind of work an L7 swarm
would parallelize. The fact that L7 is empty and the probes are queued
sequentially is **structurally suboptimal** — but L7 deployment is a
meta-decision out of scope for this audit.

### 6.4 HODGE-04 NEAR vs HODGE-06 [10*] tension

HODGE-04 (CY3 H^3 upper bound 2σ·τ=96) is at [9] NEAR — flagged as
heuristic over Kreuzer-Skarke median, "not a draft proof, empirical
alignment only" (millennium-hodge §X.1 #4).

HODGE-06 (Π_HODGE_int = τ·n·J_2 = 576) is at [10*] — but the source
explicitly labels it "small-prime-order approximation" and dfs-24 P3 flags
it as numerological housekeeping pending Mostaed Weil-class divisibility
check.

These two rows have **inverted strength vs honesty** — the more honestly
flagged claim sits at higher tier. This is a candidate L9 (molt) item: a
review pass might propose moving HODGE-06 toward [10] or HODGE-04 explicitly
into a "physics-empirical" sub-tier. Out of scope for this audit; logged
for future molt.

### 6.5 Y7 utility R3 = 3.9 vs BT-545 strength 7

Axis Y7 has utility 3.9 (low among the nine axes), but its strength on BT-545
is 7 (its main BT). This means BT-545 absorbs Y7's *entire* utility, but Y7
itself is among the weakest axes after R3 demotion. BT-545 is therefore
**structurally under-funded** at the axis level — it is "a strong claim on
a weak axis."

This is a system-level constraint, not a BT-545-internal tension. The fix
would be to lift Y7 utility (e.g., via Moonshine-barrier resolution or new
lattice-VOA inputs), not to push harder inside BT-545.

---

## §7 Next probes (3-5, with falsifiers)

Following dfs-24's research-only convention.

### 7.1 Probe Q1 — Ladder L8 (wake) retrospective audit on BT-545

**Question**: Has any earlier BT-545 row been silently downgraded or
contradicted by a later one? Does the 2026-04-12..04-15 dfs round-block
contain row-level inconsistencies the §X BLOWUP did not catch?

**Sharpening step**: diff the BT-545 block in
`theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md` at the 2026-04-12 commit vs
the 2026-04-25 commit. Flag any row whose tier moved without a corresponding
atlas-promotion log entry.

**Expected output**: zero (clean monotone), one (single anomaly), or many
(row-tag drift). UNKNOWN until executed.

**Falsifier F-Q1**: if more than 2 row-level tier moves are found without
matching log entries, the BT-545 honesty gate has been breached and the entire
block needs a Y9 audit.

### 7.2 Probe Q2 — execute dfs-24 P1 (K3 Mukai ↔ Niemeier embedding)

**Question**: per dfs-24 P1, does the J_2=24 in χ(K3), Mukai-rank, and
Niemeier-count reduce to one identifiable embedding morphism?

**Sharpening step**: write down Λ̃_K3 = H^0 ⊕ H^2 ⊕ H^4 with signature
(τ, J_2−τ) = (4, 20). Cross-check against Niemeier table (BT-547 #42).
Confirm (or deny) Λ̃_K3 ↪ Λ_24 sign-flipped embedding.

**Expected output**: one new BT-545 row "Mukai lattice rank = J_2 via
K3→Niemeier embedding" tagged EXACT, OR a falsifier-fire that demotes one of
the existing two J_2=24 rows.

**Falsifier F-Q2**: dfs-24 F-P1 inherited verbatim — no Mukai↔Niemeier
isometric embedding preserving rank 24 ⇒ demote one J_2=24 row.

### 7.3 Probe Q3 — execute dfs-24 P2 (Voevodsky degree-3 disambiguation)

**Question**: are Bloch-Kato degree 3 and CY3 minimal-open-locus dim 3
**logically dependent** (same underlying degree-3 substrate) or
**independent** (two separate hits on the integer 3)?

**Sharpening step**: locate Voevodsky 2003 Ann. Math. Section X (Rost-Voevodsky
inductive core) and Geisser-Levine 2001 (motivic-cohomology char(k)
dependence). Decide the dependence direction.

**Expected output**: at most two new BT-545 rows tagged "(crossover with
BT-1409-03, conditional)". Status stays `conjecture` in
`_hypotheses_index.json` until one Rost-Voevodsky paper section is pinned.

**Falsifier F-Q3a** (= dfs-24 F-P2a): Rost-Voevodsky degree 3 shown
char(k)-dependent ⇒ drop cd_l=φ=2 absorption.

**Falsifier F-Q3b** (= dfs-24 F-P2b): Bloch-Kato degree-3 core shown logically
independent of CY3 dim-3 ⇒ keep two rows (not one).

### 7.4 Probe Q4 — Π_HODGE_int = J_2² collapse calibration

**Question**: per dfs-24 P3, does Π_HODGE_int = 576 = J_2² simplify the
triple-match into a single Mukai-rank-squared invariant? Is there a Mostaed
Weil-class count on abelian 6-folds matching 576 / k for k ∈ {1, φ, τ}?

**Sharpening step**: read Mostaed 2026 (arXiv:2603.20268v1) §3 on Weil-class
enumeration. Extract the count. Divide by 576, by 288 (=576/φ), by 144
(=576/τ) — flag any integer hit.

**Expected output**: confirm-collapse OR demote HODGE-06 from [10*] to [10] or
[9] depending on what the count is.

**Falsifier F-Q4** (= dfs-24 F-P3): Mostaed Weil-class count ≠ J_2²/{1,φ,τ}
⇒ demote Π_HODGE_int triple-match to NEAR.

### 7.5 Probe Q5 — Ladder L5 (dream) AdS_7/CFT_6 holographic share audit

**Question**: §X.2 free-composite invokes AdS_7/CFT_6 (M-theory boundary
6-manifold Hodge structure). Is this a real cross-domain n=6 hit or a label
collision (the "6" in AdS_7's boundary-dim and the "6" in n=6 perfect-number
arithmetic could be unrelated)?

**Sharpening step**: read Strominger-Yau-Zaslow (mirror symmetry / SYZ) and
the (2,0)-theory boundary structure. Decide whether the boundary dim is
**forced by holography** to coincide with CY3 d_R=6 or just **labels-equal**.

**Expected output**: either a new HODGE-08 atlas row at [10] (genuine
holographic n=6 lock), or an explicit COUNTER-EXAMPLE entry under §7.10 noting
"AdS_7 boundary dim 6 is M-theory-forced, not n=6-derived."

**Falsifier F-Q5**: if the (2,0)-theory boundary dim 6 is shown to come from
M-theory dim 11 = sopfr·... (which is its own arithmetic), it is independent of
the n=6 perfect-number lock and the §X.2 holographic share is downgraded to
a free-composite label-match.

## §8 Falsifiers active

Consolidated registry of falsifiers currently armed for BT-545.

### 8.1 Inherited from millennium-hodge §X.5

- **F1**: CY3 h^{2,1} Kreuzer-Skarke median ≠ σ·τ=48 (±15%) ⇒ HODGE-04 H^3
  bound discarded.
- **F2**: Weil-locus minimum CM dim ≠ σ/φ_E = 6 ⇒ HODGE-03 minimal-open-locus
  discarded.
- **F3**: Hodge addressing-axis chronology τ_5 (5th independent addressing)
  discovered ⇒ HODGE-05 τ=4 axis-count discarded.
- **F4**: Mostaed positivity orbit dim ≠ τ=4 ⇒ Mostaed-conditional-Weil
  internal n=6 alignment discarded.
- **F5**: abelian sixfold h^{3,3} ≠ 20 = φ·J_2 − σ + τ (measured)
  ⇒ HODGE-02 Weil-class number-theory alignment discarded.

### 8.2 Inherited from dfs-24-hodge §"Falsifiers registered"

- **F-P1**: no Mukai↔Niemeier isometric embedding preserving rank 24 ⇒
  demote one J_2=24 row.
- **F-P2a**: Rost-Voevodsky degree 3 char(k)-dependent ⇒ drop cd_l=φ=2 absorption.
- **F-P2b**: Bloch-Kato degree 3 logically independent of CY3 dim 3 ⇒ keep
  two rows (not one).
- **F-P3**: Mostaed Weil-class count ≠ J_2²/{1,φ,τ} ⇒ demote Π_HODGE_int to
  NEAR.

### 8.3 New from §7 above

- **F-Q1**: > 2 silent BT-545 row-tier moves found ⇒ Y9 audit required.
- **F-Q2** = **F-P1** (alias).
- **F-Q3a** = **F-P2a** (alias).
- **F-Q3b** = **F-P2b** (alias).
- **F-Q4** = **F-P3** (alias).
- **F-Q5**: AdS_7 boundary dim 6 shown M-theory-forced (independent of n=6
  perfect-number lock) ⇒ §X.2 holographic share demoted to free-composite
  label-match.

### 8.4 Honesty meta-falsifier

- **F-OMEGA-545**: if any reader of this audit finds BT-545 main-claim flipped
  from MISS to PARTIAL/NEAR/EXACT inside this report, the report itself is
  invalid and must be retracted. (No such flip is intended; this is a
  self-falsifier guarding against accidental promotion language.)

**Total active falsifiers**: 5 (F1..F5) + 4 (F-P1, F-P2a, F-P2b, F-P3) + 2
(F-Q1, F-Q5) + 1 (F-OMEGA-545) = **12 armed**.

## §9 Summary

- **Ladder occupancy**: 4/12 firm, 7/12 including-partial. L1/L2/L3 strong;
  L7/L11 empty; L5/L8/L9 UNKNOWN.
- **Ω-saturation**: composite ≈ 0.43 (UNCALIBRATED); ceiling 0.835 → distance
  ≈ 0.40; far from 0.9 paper_trigger.
- **Atlas chain**: 11 nodes / 14 days (≈ 1.3-day cadence); monotone in
  atlas-density, frozen in proof-direction. Honesty gate held.
- **Closure (a..e)**: 0/5 firm-met, 1/5 partial-met (c), 4/5 not-met.
- **Tensions**: REGULAR sub-graph caps ladder ROI; L7 swarm vacancy vs queued
  probes; Y7 utility 3.9 under-funds BT-545.
- **Next probes**: Q1 wake-audit, Q2/Q3/Q4 = dfs-24 P1/P2/P3 execution,
  Q5 AdS dream-audit. All research-only.
- **Falsifiers active**: 12 (5 inherited §X + 4 inherited dfs-24 + 2 new + 1 self).
- **Millennium resolved**: **0/7 unchanged**. BT-545 main-claim MISS preserved.

End of audit. No proof claim, no atlas promotion, no row tier change.
