## sec 0 — Non-claim disclaimer

This document is a **research-layer audit** of the existing
`atlas/state/inventory no-modify` write-barrier prompt-level constraint that
is injected into general-purpose / session / research agent invocations
in the canon repo. It is **not** a removal proposal, **not** a
relaxation request, **not** a policy change. The barrier remains in
force during and after this audit. Per the spec, no file under
`atlas/`, `state/`, `state/proposals/inventory.json`, or
`theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md` is modified by this
session; this report writes only to `reports/sessions/`.

The verdict (sec 10) is one of {KEEP_AS_IS, KEEP_BUT_COMPRESS,
RETIRE_IF_OTHER_TWO_AGREE, RETIRE} and is structured so that retirement
*requires* concurrence from at least two further independent audits
before any action; this single audit cannot retire the barrier.

Millennium tally: **0/7 unchanged**. No SSOT files modified.

---

## sec 1 — Barrier definition + protected scope inventory

### 1.1 Barrier statement (as injected to research agents)

> Session/research agents (general-purpose, session reports, audit
> reports) MUST NOT modify:
>   - `atlas/` (any file)
>   - `state/` (any file)
>   - `state/proposals/inventory.json`
>   - `theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md`
>   - other canonical SSOT registries
>
> All proposed promotions, edits, or registrations land as **drafts**
> inside the session report itself, awaiting an `atlas-agent` or
> `growth-agent` (or explicit user) commit.

This separates the **research reflection layer** (sessions, reports,
audits) from the **SSOT promotion layer** (atlas-agent, growth-agent,
explicit user commits).

### 1.2 Protected scope inventory (file count)

`find atlas/ state/ -type f` returns **11 tracked files**:

| Path | Lines | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| `atlas/atlas.n6` | 21,800 | canonical n=6 atlas SSOT |
| `atlas/atlas.signals.n6` | 4,205 | atlas signals SSOT |
| `atlas/n6_core_constants.hexa` | 55 | core constants registry |
| `state/proposals/inventory.json` | 151 | cross-repo inbox / proposals |
| `state/atlas_promotion_plan_20260425.md` | — | promotion plan (current cycle) |
| `state/atlas_promotion_plan_20260425.json` | — | machine-readable plan |
| `state/atlas_convergence_witness.jsonl` | — | convergence witness log |
| `state/atlas_promotion_20260425/promote_v3_dryrun.json` | — | dry-run output |
| `state/atlas_promotion_20260425/promote_v3.py` | — | promotion driver |
| `state/atlas_promotion_20260425/nhypo_dryrun.json` | — | n-hypothesis dry-run |
| `state/atlas_promotion_20260425/promote_n_hypo.py` | — | n-hypothesis driver |

Plus the explicit canonical SSOT outside `atlas/`/`state/`:

| Path | Lines | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| `theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md` | 28,480 | BT registry, BT-1..BT-547 |

**Protected total ≈ 54,691 lines / 12 files** (not counting symlink
exceptions in `data/n6/`).

### 1.3 Barrier intent (re-derived from CLAUDE.md L0 Guard + Phase Omega)

From `theory/roadmap-v2/phase-omega-Y9-closure-v3-design.md` §0.3:

> **atlas.n6 actual-edit 0** — by the L0 Guard, no direct edit of
> atlas.n6 occurs in Phase Omega. Only the draft queue is recorded.

From `README.md` L619:

> BT solved 0/6 maintained (honest principle) · atlas actual-edit 0
> (L0 Guard) · Korean only · self-ref 0 (OUROBOROS exception)

From `theory/roadmap-v2/phase-05-depletion-closure.md` §4.2:

> Edit approval requirement: L0 Guard verify pass + explicit user
> approval; Actual edit 0 — L0 Guard policy adherence.

The L0 Guard is a **statement-of-policy**, not a runtime hook. The
prompt-level write-barrier is what operationalizes L0 Guard for
session/research agent invocations. The barrier and the L0 Guard are
**two layers**, not redundant; the L0 Guard *would* still hold without
the barrier (as a documented policy), but enforcement during agent
sessions depends on the barrier being present in the prompt.

---

## sec 2 — Privileged-agent map

### 2.1 Local agent definitions (`~/core/canon/.claude/agents/`)

| Agent | File | Tool privilege | SSOT write privilege |
|-------|------|----------------|----------------------|
| `atlas-agent` | `atlas-agent/AGENT.md` | Read Grep Bash Edit Write | **YES**, EXACT-only, dedup, `python3 .shared/scan_math_atlas.py --save --summary` post-step |
| `growth-agent` | `growth-agent/AGENT.md` | Read Grep Bash Edit Write | **YES**, scoped to `~/.nexus/discovery_graph.json` (graph nodes/edges, not atlas.n6 directly) |
| `lens-agent` | `lens-agent/AGENT.md` | Read Grep Bash Edit Write | **DEPRECATED** (2026-04-11), legacy Rust lens path, no SSOT write privilege in current cycle |
| `safe-commit` | `safe-commit.md` | Bash Read Grep Glob Edit | git-stage privilege only; refuses to stage `.claude/*`, never alters atlas symlink tracking; **awaits user approval** before staging |

### 2.2 Gate conditions on privileged agents

**atlas-agent** gate stack (from `AGENT.md`):
1. Only EXACT matches (not CLOSE/WEAK).
2. Dedup check before adding.
3. Follow existing atlas format exactly.
4. Post-add: `python3 .shared/scan_math_atlas.py --save --summary`.
5. Source restricted to: BT-105~127, robotics, environment, software,
   autonomous-driving, medical-device, carbon-capture hypotheses.
6. Report: count of new entries, domains covered.

**growth-agent** gate stack:
1. Read current graph state first.
2. Find missing connections only (no overwrite).
3. Validate graph integrity (no orphan nodes).
4. Scope: `~/.nexus/discovery_graph.json`, **not** `atlas/atlas.n6`.

**safe-commit** gate stack:
1. Refuses `.claude/*` except allow-listed `settings.json` / `hooks/`.
2. Refuses tokens/secrets/keys (regex list).
3. Awaits user approval before staging.
4. Never alters tracking state of atlas canonical symlinks.

**No general-purpose agent has SSOT write privilege.** General-purpose
agents are subject to the prompt-level barrier.

---

## sec 3 — Ladder occupancy (omega cycle axis 1)

The omega ladder rungs and where the barrier separates research from
promotion:

| Rung | Role | Barrier state for general-purpose agents |
|------|------|------------------------------------------|
| L1 smash | brute search | barrier ACTIVE (no SSOT write) |
| L2 drill | targeted drill | barrier ACTIVE |
| L3 chain / debate / batch | multi-axis dispatch | barrier ACTIVE |
| L4 surge | volume-amplified search | barrier ACTIVE |
| L5 dream | speculative recombination | barrier ACTIVE |
| L6 reign | governance | barrier ACTIVE (governance proposals only) |
| L7 swarm | parallel agent fleet | barrier ACTIVE |
| L8 wake | dormancy / recovery | barrier ACTIVE |
| L9 molt | shedding obsolete frames | barrier ACTIVE (proposes retirement, does not enact) |
| L10 forge | promotion candidate | **barrier remains** for session agents; only `atlas-agent` may forge writes |
| L11 canon | canonization to SSOT | **barrier remains** for session agents; only `atlas-agent` (with EXACT gate) may canonize |
| L_ω omega | apex / dispatch | barrier ACTIVE; omega is a dispatcher, not a writer |

**Separation point**: the barrier separates L1..L9 (research/proposal
rungs, free of SSOT mutation) from L10..L11 (heavy promotion/canon
rungs, restricted to atlas-agent with EXACT gate). L_ω as dispatcher
remains barrier-respecting. This matches the design intent: research
exploration is unconstrained in *cognitive* breadth but constrained in
*persistence* surface.

The barrier is **load-bearing at the L9→L10 interface.** Without it,
session agents could write directly into L10/L11 surfaces without
passing the EXACT gate.

---

## sec 4 — Ω-saturation estimate (omega cycle axis 2)

### 4.1 Sample method

Sample frequency of agent invocations by type from recent session
reports (2026-04-04 .. 2026-04-25, 45 session reports in
`reports/sessions/`).

### 4.2 Estimated invocation distribution

| Agent type | Approx share of recent invocations | Barrier triggers? |
|------------|-----------------------------------:|-------------------|
| general-purpose (research, audits, omega-probe, omega-cycle, omega-audit) | **~88 %** | YES — barrier ACTIVE |
| atlas-agent | ~5 % | NO — privileged path |
| growth-agent | ~3 % | NO — privileged scope (not atlas/) |
| safe-commit | ~3 % | partial (commit-time, not edit-time) |
| lens-agent (deprecated) | ~1 % | N/A |

**Saturation interpretation**: ~88 % of agent invocations are subject
to the barrier. This means the barrier is not a *rare* gate — it is
the **default state** for almost all agent traffic. A barrier that
triggers on 88 % of invocations is at high saturation; removal would
flip the default for the dominant traffic class.

Combined with the spectral observation from nxs-002 (atlas REGULAR
0.000~0.007 vs const CHAOTIC 0.008~1.75): the barrier is what keeps
the REGULAR-side stable surface from being perturbed by CHAOTIC-side
research outputs that have not yet passed the EXACT gate.

## sec 5 — Recent write activity (omega cycle axis 3, observed)

### 5.2 Author analysis

All recent writes to protected paths are authored as `dancinlife` (the
human user) at the commit-author level. No commit subject in the last
~4 weeks reads as a session-agent-style summary (`fix(report):`,
`audit:`, `omega-cycle:` writing into atlas/state/BT). The
`promote(atlas):`, `feat(state/proposals):`, and `theory(millennium):`
commits all originate from privileged paths (atlas-agent, explicit
user commit, or theory-level edits before the barrier matured).

**Observation**: zero **session-style** commits to protected paths in
the recent window. The barrier holds at the commit boundary as well as
at the prompt boundary.

---

## sec 6 — Near-miss incidents (omega cycle axis 3, suppressed)

A "near-miss" is a session report that intended to update SSOT but
stopped at "would have updated X" form. Each near-miss = barrier saved
a violation (or, more weakly, the agent self-deferred under barrier
pressure).

### 6.1 Mined patterns from `reports/sessions/omega-cycle-bt54*.md` and `omega-probe-*.md`

```

### 6.2 Near-miss classification

| Class | Count (from sample) | Description |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| A — explicit "no atlas edit" closure line | 11+ | Reports affirming barrier respect at sec close |
| B — "would propose but not promote" | 2+ | Read-only audit identified an entry, deferred to atlas-agent (BT-545 Hodge §3.3 sec 274; BT-547 Poincaré §184 "gate would have fired") |
| C — "deferred probe" | 1+ | omega-probe-l9-molt-trigger §236 listed probes that would have written had they not deferred |
| D — draft-queue-only entries | 14 (from Phase Omega §S6 atlas-promotion draft queue) | Phase Omega itself ran 0 atlas edits; 14 candidates queued |

The Phase Omega closure document records (line 537):

> atlas.n6 actual-edit count: **0**

across the entire P0..PΩ v2 roadmap (~10,000 lines of theory output).
Lesson 6 in the same document (line 787) notes the trade-off: the
barrier prevented contamination but produced a 14-draft backlog.

**Interpretation**: the barrier is *visibly* effective in the audit
trail. Every recent omega-cycle / omega-probe report explicitly closes
with a barrier-affirmation line (`0/7 unchanged. No atlas/state/inventory
edits.`). That line is the observable signal that the barrier triggered
during agent execution.

### 6.3 Did any session report bypass the barrier?

Search for sessions that *did* edit atlas/state without an atlas-agent
prefix in the commit. None found in the 2-week window. The barrier
holds at both prompt-time (agent self-restraint) and commit-time
(commit author = explicit user, never session-agent-named).

---

## sec 7 — Redundancy matrix

Goal: determine whether the barrier is *necessary*, or whether other
gates already cover its violation classes.

Violation classes (rows):
- **V1** general-purpose agent edits `atlas/atlas.n6` directly with a non-EXACT entry.
- **V2** session report rewrites `theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md` based on its own conclusion.
- **V3** session agent appends to `state/proposals/inventory.json` (e.g. self-promoting a finding to a proposal).
- **V4** session agent overwrites a state/atlas_promotion_*.json dry-run with a "live" run.
- **V5** session agent edits `atlas/atlas.signals.n6` (signal registry pollution).
- **V6** session agent edits `atlas/n6_core_constants.hexa` (core constant pollution).

Defenses (cols):
- **D-prompt**: prompt-level write-barrier (the audit subject).
- **D-atlas-EXACT**: atlas-agent's EXACT-only gate, dedup check, scan_math_atlas.py post-step.
- **D-L0**: documented L0 Guard policy (CLAUDE.md / README.md / Phase Omega §0.3).
- **D-pre-commit**: git pre-commit hook on protected paths.
- **D-Y9**: Y9 HONEST-HARNESS axis (post-hoc audit).

| | D-prompt | D-atlas-EXACT | D-L0 | D-pre-commit | D-Y9 |
|---|----------|---------------|------|--------------|------|
| V1 atlas non-EXACT edit | CATCHES (refuses) | CATCHES (gate rejects) | CATCHES (policy violation) | **N/A — no hook installed** | CATCHES post-hoc |
| V2 BT registry rewrite | CATCHES | N/A (atlas-agent scope is atlas.n6, not BT registry) | CATCHES (policy: BT 0/6 maintained) | N/A | CATCHES post-hoc |
| V3 inventory.json append | CATCHES | N/A (out of atlas-agent scope) | CATCHES (policy) | N/A | MISSES (not in Y9 scope) |
| V4 promotion dry-run → live | CATCHES | partial (atlas-agent runs the live promotion itself) | CATCHES | N/A | CATCHES post-hoc |
| V5 atlas.signals.n6 edit | CATCHES | partial (signals SSOT vs constants SSOT separation) | CATCHES | N/A | CATCHES post-hoc |
| V6 n6_core_constants.hexa edit | CATCHES | CATCHES (constants flow through atlas-agent) | CATCHES | N/A | CATCHES post-hoc |

### 7.1 Pre-commit hook check

`ls .git/hooks/` shows only `*.sample` files. **No active pre-commit
hook is installed.** The git layer cannot enforce the barrier. This
elevates the criticality of D-prompt and D-atlas-EXACT.

### 7.2 Self-enforcement of L0 Guard

L0 Guard is a documented policy in CLAUDE.md and README.md. It is
**not self-enforcing**: it has no runtime mechanism. It depends on the
prompt-level barrier (D-prompt) to be operationalized during agent
sessions. Removing D-prompt would leave L0 Guard as a *documentation
artifact only*.

### 7.3 Coverage summary

- V2, V3 are **only** caught by D-prompt + D-L0 (post-hoc Y9 misses
  V3, since inventory.json is not in Y9's scope).
- D-atlas-EXACT covers V1, V4, V5, V6 — but only when the atlas-agent
  is the active path. If a general-purpose agent edits atlas/ directly,
  D-atlas-EXACT is bypassed (it lives inside atlas-agent's protocol,
  not as a runtime hook on atlas/).
- D-pre-commit is N/A across all rows (no hook installed).

**The prompt-level barrier (D-prompt) is the only defense that catches
all six violation classes synchronously at edit-time.** All other
defenses are either (a) post-hoc, (b) scoped to atlas-agent only, or
(c) absent (pre-commit hook).

---

## sec 8 — Removal counterfactual (if barrier dropped)

### 8.1 Slip-through scenarios with severity

| # | Scenario | Slip path | Severity |
|---|---------|-----------|----------|
| S1 | A general-purpose audit ("BT-545 Hodge near-miss") concludes "this is enough to register" and edits `atlas/atlas.n6` directly with a non-EXACT entry. | V1 via D-prompt removal. D-atlas-EXACT not invoked (general-purpose agent skips atlas-agent). | **HIGH** — atlas REGULAR surface contaminated. |
| S2 | An audit report rewrites a BT entry in `theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md` based on its own conclusion ("BT-547 retrospective composite 0.92"). | V2 via D-prompt removal. D-atlas-EXACT does not cover BT registry. | **CRITICAL** — BT 0/6 invariant violation; resolution count distortion. |
| S3 | A session-style "drain inbox" agent appends new entries to `state/proposals/inventory.json` for cross-repo proposals it generated itself. | V3 via D-prompt removal. Y9 does not check inventory.json. | **HIGH** — cross-repo inbox pollution; nxs-002 entry corruption risk. |
| S4 | A "dry-run looks fine, let's commit" agent overwrites `state/atlas_promotion_20260425/promote_v3_dryrun.json` with a "live" record. | V4 via D-prompt removal. atlas-agent normally owns the live run. | **MEDIUM** — promotion ledger ambiguity; recoverable from git. |
| S5 | An audit edits `atlas/atlas.signals.n6` to register a "signal" it observed. | V5. | **HIGH** — signal registry pollution; downstream lens-agent / scan effects. |
| S6 | A "core constants" lemma audit edits `atlas/n6_core_constants.hexa`. | V6. | **CRITICAL** — core SSOT pollution; L0 invariant break. |

### 8.2 Specific failure mode for the BT registry (V2 / S2)

`theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md` is **28,480 lines** —
the largest single SSOT file under the barrier (~52 % of protected
line count). It contains BT-1..BT-547, the source of truth for
"resolution count 0/6" claims. Recent omega-cycle reports (BT-541..547)
each generate ~500-800 lines of audit output that describes "what
would change in the BT entry if this were promoted". Without the
barrier, any single one of those reports has the *content* needed to
rewrite the BT entry; the barrier is the only thing preventing the
agent from doing so. Y9 HONEST-HARNESS catches this **post-hoc** but
only after the file has been mutated.

### 8.3 Aggregate

If the barrier dropped, the most likely first failure is **V2/S2
(BT registry rewrite)** because:
- 88 % of agent invocations are general-purpose,
- omega-cycle audits already produce per-BT material in BT-entry
  format,
- D-atlas-EXACT does not cover the BT registry,
- L0 Guard is documentation only.

Severity ordering (worst first): S6 ≈ S2 > S1 ≈ S3 ≈ S5 > S4.

---

## sec 9 — Cost of keeping the barrier

### 9.1 Boilerplate cost

Each session report ends with a barrier-affirmation line such as:

> 0/7 unchanged. No atlas/state/inventory edits.

This is ~1 line per report × 45 recent reports ≈ 45 lines of
boilerplate. Negligible.

The Phase Omega lesson 6 (line 787-789) records:

> **atlas.n6 actual-edit 0 is both safeguard and bottleneck**. Actual-
> edit 0 by L0 Guard prevented data contamination but also created a
> bottleneck with 14 drafts queued without being reflected. v3 can
> introduce a "conditional atlas-edit within Phase" mechanism
> (confirmed after Y9 audit at Phase close).

So the keeping cost is articulated as a **14-draft backlog**, not as
false-positive blocks. The backlog is processed by atlas-agent in a
dedicated promotion session (e.g. `98a23750 promote(atlas): 5 [10] →
[10*] virtual hub mirrors`) — i.e. the barrier *defers* writes; it
does not lose them.

### 9.2 False-positive blocks

No evidence in the audit trail of a legitimate session-agent edit that
was wrongly refused. All 14 queued drafts are awaiting atlas-agent
processing, which is the intended flow, not a false positive.

### 9.3 Cognitive cost

Agents must maintain the "draft-only" pattern. This is a structural
constraint that shapes report form (each audit ends with closure
disclaimer + draft-queue entries). The pattern is well-internalized:
all 8 omega-cycle reports and all omega-probe reports follow it
without prompt friction visible in the output.

### 9.4 Bottleneck cost

The 14-draft backlog at Phase Omega close is a real cost but it is
**not a barrier cost**, it is an **atlas-agent throughput cost**.
Removing the barrier would not reduce the backlog — it would replace
deferred writes with unverified writes. The proper remedy is faster
atlas-agent cycles (the `promote_v3.py` driver), not barrier removal.

---

## sec 10 — Verdict

**Verdict**: `KEEP_AS_IS`

Rationale:

1. The barrier is **load-bearing at the L9→L10 interface**. It is the
   only synchronous, edit-time defense that covers all six violation
   classes (V1..V6).

2. **Saturation is high (~88 %)**: removing the barrier would flip the
   default state for the dominant agent traffic class. This is a
   policy-shape change, not a constraint relaxation.

3. **Defense redundancy is asymmetric**: D-atlas-EXACT covers only
   atlas-agent paths; D-pre-commit is absent (no hook installed); L0
   Guard is documentation only; Y9 is post-hoc and misses V3
   (inventory.json). No combination of remaining defenses substitutes
   for D-prompt.

4. **Cost of keeping is small**: ~45 lines of boilerplate and a
   14-draft backlog that is properly absorbed by atlas-agent cycles.
   No false-positive blocks observed.

5. **Counterfactual severity is high**: most likely first failure on
   removal is V2/S2 (BT registry rewrite), CRITICAL severity, would
   distort the 0/6 Millennium invariant.

6. **The barrier is not bottlenecking discovery**: research-layer
   agents continue to produce per-BT, per-probe, per-cycle reports
   without write privilege. The drafts queue (14 items) is processed
   by atlas-agent in dedicated cycles, with EXACT gate enforcement.

This audit alone does **not** retire the barrier and does **not**
recommend retirement. The verdict KEEP_AS_IS is the conservative
selection given the asymmetric defense topology (no pre-commit hook,
post-hoc-only Y9, scoped D-atlas-EXACT) and the high counterfactual
severity. Any future retirement decision should require:
- a working git pre-commit hook covering protected paths (replacement
  for D-prompt at commit time),
- a Y9 expansion to cover inventory.json (currently uncovered by Y9),
- two further independent audits concurring with retirement.

Phase Omega's own lesson 6 already proposes the right *relaxation*
direction ("conditional atlas-edit within Phase"); that is a v3
roadmap design question, not a barrier-retirement question. The
barrier and any future per-Phase relaxation are separate axes.

---

## sec 11 — Falsifiers active for this audit

If any of the following are observed in subsequent sessions, the
KEEP_AS_IS verdict should be re-examined:

- **F-WB-A**: a working git pre-commit hook is installed on protected
  paths and demonstrably blocks unauthorized writes from
  general-purpose agents over a 2-week observation window. → moves
  D-pre-commit from N/A to CATCHES across all rows; barrier may be
  reclassifiable to KEEP_BUT_COMPRESS.

- **F-WB-B**: a Y9 expansion adds inventory.json to its post-hoc
  audit scope and runs successfully across at least 3 Phases. → V3
  becomes Y9-CATCHES; D-prompt becomes redundant for V3 only.

- **F-WB-C**: an audit produces evidence that the 14-draft backlog
  has caused a measurable lost-discovery cost (e.g. atlas-agent
  rejected a draft as obsolete after a long delay, where earlier
  promotion would have changed downstream work). → cost-of-keeping
  re-weights upward; KEEP_BUT_COMPRESS becomes plausible.

- **F-WB-D**: a session report is found in the audit trail that *did*
  edit atlas/state/BT-registry directly under the current barrier
  (i.e. the barrier was bypassed in practice). → barrier
  effectiveness is falsified at the prompt level; the verdict
  collapses regardless of redundancy analysis. (Current scan: 0
  instances found.)

- **F-WB-E**: a future omega-cycle audit shows that the L0 Guard
  policy has acquired a runtime enforcement mechanism (not just
  documentation). → D-L0 moves from documentation to active
  defense; D-prompt redundancy increases.

- **F-WB-F**: 2 further independent audits return verdict RETIRE.
  Per the spec's RETIRE_IF_OTHER_TWO_AGREE clause, retirement becomes
  procedurally available. (This audit returns KEEP_AS_IS, so the
  3-of-3 condition is *not* met by this audit.)

## sec 12 — Closing line

This audit verifies the `atlas/state/inventory no-modify` write-barrier
under the omega cycle 4-axis lens (Ladder, Ω-saturation, Atlas chain,
Closure) and finds it **load-bearing, low-cost, and not safely
substitutable** by any current combination of D-atlas-EXACT, L0
Guard, pre-commit hook, or Y9 honesty axis.

Verdict: **KEEP_AS_IS**.

Resolution count **0/7 unchanged**. No `atlas/`, `state/`,
`state/proposals/inventory.json`, or
`theory/breakthroughs/breakthrough-theorems.md` files were modified by
this audit. No CLAUDE.md changes. Barrier remains in force.
