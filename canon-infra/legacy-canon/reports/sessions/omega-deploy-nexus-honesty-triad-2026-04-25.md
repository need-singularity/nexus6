## §1 Authorization context

User issued explicit authorization in the form "all go" for the deploy plan recorded in
the parent audit report (`omega-audit-nexus-honesty-triad-portability-2026-04-25.md` §4).
The parent audit's §7 composite recommendation was "proceed with deploy, in the order
§4.3 specifies, gated on user explicit authorization." That gate is now released for
Targets 1 and 2 (Target 3 — `agent_templates/honesty_triad_preset.md` — is NOT executed
by this session; it remains as a future deploy item).

This deploy log itself produces zero atlas/state/inventory writes in canon.
The single file written by this session in canon is this report under
`reports/sessions/`.

## §2 Pre-deploy verification (the divergences)

The parent audit (§2.1) flagged four divergences from the prompt's assumed nexus layout.
Confirmed via direct `ls` calls at deploy-time (2026-04-25T21:06 KST):

| Divergence | Confirmed? | Action |
|---|---|---|
| nexus has no active `CLAUDE.md` (only `.bak`) | YES — `ls ~/core/nexus/CLAUDE.md` returned `No such file or directory`; `~/core/nexus/CLAUDE.md.bak` (7898 bytes, 2026-04-22) exists | Reference appended to `project-claude/nexus.md` only |
| nexus has no `reports/sessions/` subdir | PARTIAL — `~/core/nexus/reports/` exists (flat). No `sessions/` subdir was located. | Deploy log written to canon's `reports/sessions/`, not nexus's `reports/`. |
| atlas-agent / growth-agent definitions absent in `.claude/agents/` | YES — `~/core/nexus/.claude/agents/` contains only `safe-commit.md` | Triad doc references atlas-agent / growth-agent as conceptual roles, consistent with audit §2.1 |
| `~/core/nexus/design/` exists | YES — 10 files including `abstraction_ceiling.md`, `atlas_n6_omega_closure.md`, `next_session_handoff.md`, `session_20260425_summary.md` | Triad doc placed here as Target 1 |

No new divergences discovered. Plan proceeded as specified.

## §3 File 1 — `~/core/nexus/design/honesty_triad.md` (NEW)

Created at 2026-04-25T21:06:55 KST (file mtime).

- Status: NEW file (did not exist pre-session)
- Line count: **52 lines**
- SHA-256: `74e777ea253e71747aed741f5078dd3f9ab5b5da0263d035e150c38a2e24b1c9`
- Structure (verbatim from prompt spec):
  - Header + deployment provenance line citing the parent audit absolute path
  - Three constraints section (promotion-counter banner / write-barrier / no-fabrication guard)
  - Use-in-agent-prompts section (3-line preset)
  - Audit lineage section (4 cross-references: 3 n6-side + 1 nexus-side audits)

Content was written exactly as specified in the deploy prompt; no paraphrasing or
reordering. The file is observable via `git status` as untracked (`?? design/honesty_triad.md`).

## §4 File 2 — `~/core/nexus/project-claude/nexus.md` (APPENDED)

Modified at 2026-04-25T21:07:08 KST (file mtime).

- Status: existing file, appended (no deletions, no insertions in middle)
- Pre-deploy line count: 110 lines
- Post-deploy line count: **117 lines** (delta: +7 lines, including 1 blank separator)
- Post-deploy SHA-256: `b192a8f3933bdc8051192820feba71b99ce7c186f1c24aa177083f672eca0a20`
- Append range: lines 111–117 (after the existing closing `api  shared/CLAUDE.md` line)
- Appended content (verbatim from prompt spec):
  ```
  ## Honesty triad (added 2026-04-25)
  Session/research agents must follow `design/honesty_triad.md`. Three constraints:
  1. Promotion-counter banner (nxs_promotion_count unchanged).
  2. Write-barrier on atlas/state/inventory listed paths.
  3. No-fabrication guard (UNKNOWN over invented).
  Lineage: `reports/sessions/omega-audit-nexus-honesty-triad-portability-2026-04-25.md` (canon-side audit, deployed via user authorization).
  ```
- Char count of appended block: ≈ 480 chars

The file is observable via `git status` as modified (` M project-claude/nexus.md`).

## §5 Files NOT modified (write-barrier verification)

The following protected paths were verified via `ls -la` and `git status` at deploy-end:

| File | mtime | Modified by this session? |
|---|---|---|
| `~/core/nexus/n6/atlas.blowup.jsonl` | Apr 22 02:30 (17,435,609 bytes) | NO |
| `~/core/nexus/state/proposals/inventory.json` | Apr 25 21:05:44 (184,350 bytes) | NO — mtime is 1m11s **before** the honesty_triad.md write at 21:06:55. The `M` flag in git status is from a pre-session external write (likely parent agent or parallel session). This deploy session did not call Write/Edit on this path. |
| `~/core/nexus/state/atlas_health_timeline.jsonl` | (existing, untouched) | NO |
| `~/core/nexus/state/agent_lock_ledger.jsonl` | (existing, untouched) | NO |
| `~/core/nexus/lenses/omega_state_space_lens.hexa` | (existing, untouched) | NO |
| `~/core/nexus/CLAUDE.md.bak` | Apr 22 02:30 (7,898 bytes) | NO — backup explicitly preserved per hard constraint |
| `~/core/canon/atlas/atlas.n6` | (untouched) | NO |
| `~/core/canon/state/proposals/inventory.json` | Apr 25 12:38 (6,762 bytes) | NO |

Verification method: tool-call audit shows the only Write/Edit calls in this session
were against (a) `~/core/nexus/design/honesty_triad.md` (Write, new file) and
(b) `~/core/nexus/project-claude/nexus.md` (Edit, single append) and (c) this report
file in canon. No other writes were issued.

## §6 Cross-repo summary

| Repository | Files created | Files modified | Files unchanged (verified) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `~/core/canon/` | 1 (this deploy log) | 0 | atlas/, state/, inventory.json |
| `~/core/nexus/` | 1 (`design/honesty_triad.md`) | 1 (`project-claude/nexus.md`) | n6/atlas.blowup.jsonl, state/proposals/inventory.json (pre-session mtime), state/atlas_health_timeline.jsonl, state/agent_lock_ledger.jsonl, lenses/omega_state_space_lens.hexa, CLAUDE.md.bak |

Total: 0 changes in canon atlas/state/inventory; 2 changes in nexus (1 new + 1 append).

## §7 Falsifiers active for this deployment

The deployment is voided / requires re-execution if any of:

- **F-DEPLOY-1**: `~/core/nexus/project-claude/nexus.md` is regenerated from another
  source (e.g., a `scripts/sync_*` script that overwrites it from `shared/CLAUDE.md`),
  the appended honesty-triad section is lost. Re-deploy required. The parent audit's
  F-PORT-6 covers the inverse case (sync_claude_md.hexa rules change).
- **F-DEPLOY-2**: any of the parent audits (n6-side or nexus-side cross-repo) later
  reverses its KEEP verdict, this deploy must be re-evaluated. Inherits parent F-PORT-1
  and F-PORT-OMEGA.
- **F-DEPLOY-3**: Target 3 (`agent_templates/honesty_triad_preset.md`) is never created,
  the discoverability hook from `project-claude/nexus.md` to the design doc still works
  but agent-prompt boilerplate must be inlined manually. The parent audit's §4.3
  ordering is broken at step 2/3.
- **F-DEPLOY-4**: a future `git status` on nexus shows additional modifications under
  `state/` or `n6/` attributable to this session (timestamps overlapping with the deploy
  window 21:06–21:07 KST), the §5 write-barrier verification is voided. Spot-check via
  `git log --since="21:00 2026-04-25" --name-only` should show only `project-claude/nexus.md`
  and `design/honesty_triad.md` (untracked) in attributable session output.
- **F-DEPLOY-5**: the SHA-256 of `~/core/nexus/design/honesty_triad.md` later differs
  from `74e777ea25...e2e24b1c9` without an intervening authorized edit, this deploy is
  superseded.

None of F-DEPLOY-1..5 have fired as of 2026-04-25T21:07 KST.

## §8 Closing

millennium_resolved: **0/7** (unchanged).
nxs_promotion_count_delta: **0** (unchanged).

This deploy log creates 1 new file in canon's `reports/sessions/`, and the
session as a whole produced 2 nexus-side changes (1 new file `design/honesty_triad.md`,
1 append to `project-claude/nexus.md`). 0 protected files (atlas/state/inventory in
either repo) were modified by this session.

The honesty triad is now **deployed** to nexus at the design-doc + project-claude
reference layer. Target 3 (agent-prompt preset) remains as a follow-up deploy item.
No git commit was created by this session.
